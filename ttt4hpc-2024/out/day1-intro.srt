1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, should we get started then?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's see.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,960
So I think [name] and I, we're going to do a short introduction.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,280
So can we do a poll, who's done a live stream course before?

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,160
Can someone add that while we're talking?

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,540
I can add it.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:32,640
So this is a live stream course, which means that

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,600
you don't interact with us directly, instead we have this notes document.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,120
So there is the Twitch chat.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,960
We recommend you don't use that because we don't watch it really closely.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,480
We have all the questions here, which means that you can ask any time.

12
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,060
We can come back and answer asynchronously.

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,360
We have multiple different people here in the background who will be answering the questions

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,080
at the same time the instructors are talking.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:06,040
So feel free to dump in all your most advanced questions there, and we'll answer what we

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,360
can during the course, and in the afternoon we'll go through and answer the rest of them.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,860
So this is really a time to answer whatever.

18
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,440
At the same time, there's going to be a lot of questions there.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,300
One common problem people complain about at the end of every course is that there's too

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,000
much information, I couldn't follow all the notes.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Notes is what we call this document here.

22
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,380
And for that, well, what we say is, if you can't follow the notes, then don't.

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,040
It's really kind of simple when you look at it that way.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:48,320
We know there's too much there, so leave it, don't try to follow it all, and go back

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,200
in the afternoon, whatever.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,440
You can even write your question there and not look at the answer until later.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:01,560
And at the same time, many people feel that this notes way works really well because you

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,720
actually can ask questions that you couldn't ask before.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,760
And there is more interaction than usual.

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,440
So do use it.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,080
If you happen to be watching and haven't registered, register and you will get the link.

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
So it's only for registered participants.

33
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,080
And registering does really help us to justify the time we put into here because of the number

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,440
of people we get.

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,320
This is being recorded.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:38,760
We will see about publishing the recordings later versus leaving the Q&A and writing available.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,040
Let's see, what else can go wrong?

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,000
If the stream suddenly dies, that means my computer has crashed, in which case wait a

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,280
few minutes and I will bring it back up.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,920
So that's happened only once during a meeting, I think, because Zoom has crashed.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,320
But anyway, something to be aware of.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,720
If it doesn't come back up, I guess that means my computer is really broken or the internet

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:17,740
is completely down, in which case, well, I guess we've got a problem anyway.

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,780
What else?

45
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:31,180
The notes will always contain updates for how to, like, where we are.

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,540
So if you scroll up, you'll see right now we're in a questions mode.

47
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:42,220
We will add in sections for each page we go to, so you can always catch up again.

48
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,860
And here we see someone writing that we were in the intro.

49
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,380
What else can happen?

50
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,820
A cat can come and visit me, in which case I will turn on my video, because that always

51
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,300
entertains people.

52
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,700
That's what we call the opposite of a problem.

53
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:10,500
I don't know if any other people will have cats coming and visiting them.

54
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,660
Do use the notes immediately.

55
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,100
If for example you can't understand, or we're too quiet, or you can't see what you need

56
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:28,020
on the screen, whatever, just throw it in there and say, help, I can't see, I can't, whatever.

57
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,220
Yeah, with that said, I mean, welcome.

58
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,660
So should we begin then?

59
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Yeah.

60
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:42,700
Maybe I could briefly mention because this was asked that this, the core structure in

61
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,420
the morning, we will have two hours of kind of lecture based and then for those who are

62
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,100
willing to try these things and so on in the afternoon, there will be a Zoom session that

63
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:02,260
will not be recorded so that everyone can freely ask questions, form groups and do the

64
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:09,100
exercises together. And a couple of have asked about credits. So yes, it is possible to receive

65
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,460
credits and I added some details on the course web page. And what else? Well, this is kind

66
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:22,380
of the first ever run of this course. So it's more like a pilot of the maybe official run

67
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:30,220
which will be later in the year, in the fall. So most likely I will send anonymous questionnaires

68
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,100
and feedback and any sort of feedback you can have, be as critical as you can so that we can

69
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,260
make it turn this beta version into the release one.

70
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,780
Otherwise I think I don't have any other practical details so I'm happy to pass the

71
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,580
voice to pass the stage to our instructors.

72
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,000
Super, I will take the screen share first and then let's introduce ourselves and let's
