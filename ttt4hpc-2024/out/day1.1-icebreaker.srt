1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
are. We're live. Hopefully, every will get lots of people coming. We're in the icebreaker

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,600
time now. So let's see, what do we have for icebreakers?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,600
I've got a couple of generic demographics icebreakers.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,700
Let's see what people are.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,800
So how does this work?

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,200
So if you are registered, you should have a link to this

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,000
note.coderefinery.org document.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,900
You should be able to switch to edit mode.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,420
and then basically write stuff here.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,240
So this is the way we use to communicate.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,240
So instead of the Twitch chat, which is linear,

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,040
you can come here,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,640
you can ask questions in any order.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,640
We have a section for questions which is appearing down here,

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
and answer and ask anytime.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,480
So yeah, let's see what people say.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,560
There was a good icebreaker from last night, what was it?

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:10,160
How would you explain HPC to someone from a hundred years ago?

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Should we add that there?

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm adding it.

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:21,840
There we go, we see it coming.

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:32,920
is so difficult. I mean, in the 19th century, there used to be some calculators. So maybe

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,480
that would be the metaphor. And they are probably steam-operated, right?

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,560
Steam machines that keep this going. And then we need a mechanism to send messages from one

25
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,280
steam factory to the other, like some conveyor belts or something. That's the network. And

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,560
all just work together. Maybe the industrial revolution, is that like a metaphor for HPC?

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,520
Yeah. Or the printing machines that, you know, that you're able to

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,920
in parallel print the same book. Yeah. I guess the high performance part,

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:24,120
Well, computing part, do we have to explain what computing is to someone from a hundred

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
years ago?

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,920
I guess there's probably some mechanical calculators as an analogy.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
I think so.

33
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,320
These ones with the, you know, the wheel that you could sum and subtract.

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,000
So can we say we made that much, much, much faster?

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,440
all using electricity. And then, say, for the high-performance part, say, we can't make

36
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:57,680
one of these fast enough, so we make a lot of them, and then they communicate together

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:06,800
really efficiently.

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,780
Electricity existed back then, right?

39
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,700
Like saying there's electric lights.

40
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,700
Technically.

41
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,300
Technically, as electricity has been there before us, but yeah.

42
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,240
Did telegraphs exist back then?

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:31,100
I think it's the last few decades of the 19th century, I think, let me check.

44
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,020
No, actually, it was 1835.

45
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
Okay.

46
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,300
like the most or yeah no that was the [?] coat

47
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,900
but anyway yeah it's exciting to be here because we've been planning and discussing this course

48
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,220
for maybe i don't know two years or something like that and today finally it's happening

49
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,700
so what would you say is the spirit of this course like why are you here what do you

50
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,620
what's the thing about what we do?

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
Well, I don't know.

52
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,760
At least I've never seen something like this

53
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,660
that we are putting together in this four episode

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,560
in a sense that we've been running

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,300
and I'm sure we've been taking part

56
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,060
to introductory courses to HPC,

57
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,460
but at the end of the day, okay, good.

58
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,320
You learned those commands that you need to run,

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,140
but it's the daily struggling with working

60
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,260
with these clusters and remote and local

61
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:42,340
And so something that I guess everyone has just learned by doing on their own or by watching

62
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,980
others.

63
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,940
So I wish I had this type of introduction, I don't know, 15 years ago when I started.

64
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,940
Yeah.

65
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:59,340
I'd say it's best practices filtered by people at different centers, so really taking the

66
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,940
most common, most useful.

67
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,880
And I think what is so fun is that we will see that many, many things are really similar

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
across all the centers.

69
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,280
We will also probably see that some things are not a little bit different.

70
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,000
As instructors, we hope that they are not we will not.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,700
We are a little bit afraid that some things that we assume to work works everywhere might

72
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,380
not work everywhere.

73
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:29,360
But it's also to me the first first time that we try something like this cross border trying

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,220
to distill out what is what is it that is common?

75
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,140
And what can we learn from all of us?

76
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,560
And can we somehow abstract away the details and focus on the big picture?

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,980
So for me, the course is really about the big picture.

78
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:54,680
Do any of you know about other courses which actually use multiple, like is taught and

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,300
have participants with access to multiple different clusters by different organizations

80
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,380
and the course might work for them.

81
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,380
Not across borders.

82
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,380
No.

83
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,580
I guess maybe our June kickstart course is the closest then.

84
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,580
Yeah.

85
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Even that is.

86
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
Yeah.

87
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,420
But yeah, so during that June kickstart course, something we always heard was people, it was

88
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:29,060
a basic course where people saw, well, how to get started.

89
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:36,340
But then there's a lot of people who want some lessons about how we actually use it,

90
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,460
like what's the advanced side of things, which is a little bit hard to teach because if you

91
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,580
have basic people just learning the cluster and command line and advanced people, you

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:55,260
can't really easily serve both audiences at the same time.

93
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:02,460
So here what we've done is, this is not a basic course, and in fact a lot of things

94
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:14,480
you see might be too advanced to really fit in one thing together, but, I mean not too

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:21,660
advanced for most people here, for everyone here to do, but instead it's cool demos.

96
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,180
how we actually use it, you can get some ideas, and then go back and study yourself.

97
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,500
Okay, did I finally say that properly?

98
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Yep.

99
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Okay.

100
00:07:51,660 --> 00:08:01,480
So, what are the topics for today? Who are the teachers? Is it [name] and [name]?

101
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,960
So the first part will be [name] and me, and the second part is [name] and [name]. And today

102
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,840
we talk about resource use. We will do a super brief intro into what is high-performance computing,

103
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,040
but really like in one minute, in two minutes. And then how do we, how do we use resources

104
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,680
really in a good way. How should we approach it? And what are the different dimensions

105
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:34,060
there? So we'll talk about number of cores, amount of memory, time, and then input output.

106
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:41,040
So how should we think about reading from disk and writing to disk?

107
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:49,640
And I saw some really cool pictures last night, which were like, well, made by [name]. Such

108
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,760
an amazing metaphor for what the cluster's doing.

109
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
So...

110
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,280
Yeah, and there are different possible analogies.

111
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:04,200
We might mention some of them, just to get a real-world analogy to what's going on.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
Okay, should we get started then?
