3.1 Containers on HPC clusters - Tuesday tools and techniques for HPC

Containers are a way to run applications in a self-contained environment with all the tools that the specific application needs.  They are very useful for scientific software, which may have difficult dependencies and need to run on a variety of systems with widely varying specifications.

Unlike most container tutorials you can find, this focuses on HPC and scientific computing use cases, using Apptainer (=Singularity).  We go over both the theory behind containers and the most common operations: pulling, building yourself, running, and bind-mounting.

Do you use supercomputers in your research work? Are you curious about making your computing faster and more efficient? Join us for TTT4HPC: four self-contained episodes on best practices in High Performance Computing. This is a great chance to enhance your computational skills. What you will learn is also used a lot outside academia whenever large scale computations are needed.

Improve your cluster workflows! You've had a basic course on working with a cluster - but what do people actually do? This course shows practical examples and tips which may help you, but aren't usually covered in either basic or advanced courses.

We won't go so deep into each topic that you know everything about it, but you learn what is possible, see some examples, and know where to follow up on the tools that are right for you. The format is designed to be "fireside chat with experts", a combination of demos, type-along, and independent exercises. You can engage at different levels, depending on your interest.
