1.4 I/O - Tuesday tools and techniques for HPC

In this lesson we discuss common I/O problems, diagnosing them and avoiding them. I/O issues are usually about how the workflow is structured and can be fixed or alleviated by restucturing, moving the reads and writes to move convenient times or using the right storage system.

This lesson is mostly a demonstration, with some general discussion. We recommend you follow the demonstration.

Main points: - Filesystem can be the slowest part of many jobs - Networked filesystems tend to be best at large files, bad at many small

Do you use supercomputers in your research work? Are you curious about making your computing faster and more efficient? Join us for TTT4HPC: four self-contained episodes on best practices in High Performance Computing. This is a great chance to enhance your computational skills. What you will learn is also used a lot outside academia whenever large scale computations are needed.

Improve your cluster workflows! You've had a basic course on working with a cluster - but what do people actually do? This course shows practical examples and tips which may help you, but aren't usually covered in either basic or advanced courses.

We won't go so deep into each topic that you know everything about it, but you learn what is possible, see some examples, and know where to follow up on the tools that are right for you. The format is designed to be "fireside chat with experts", a combination of demos, type-along, and independent exercises. You can engage at different levels, depending on your interest.
