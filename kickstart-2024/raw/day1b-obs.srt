1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hello.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So I suppose we are back with the streaming.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,360
We had a little bit of issues that are not under our control

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,680
with whatever internet provider is between Twitch TV

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,200
and the location of the streaming server.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,880
But hopefully, you are able to see.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,600
It might not look exactly like it

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,840
used to look at the beginning of the session,

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,000
but we are back.

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,560
It is coming on the stream and now we basically see the Canoes room view

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,800
with the images on the side.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Yes, so sorry for this issue but sometimes it's still better than what happened a couple of years

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
ago during code refinement streaming where the whole internet was down or a huge subset of the

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,280
whole internet. So people of course realized that it wasn't us. It was literally 50% of the internet

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,200
that was down. Today we only have some part of Helsinki internet. I think what's interesting is

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
that both these incidents happened at the same presentation that I'm about to give here. So

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,400
it's correlated with this talk. All right, so we have two data points that this presentation

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,720
coincides with some network outage. Let's see if the third time will happen again.

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,040
But anyway, let's get to the business. We have now here with us [name], who is the master

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,080
of everything. Well, master is maybe a big word, but at least one of the biggest drivers of the

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,920
Code Refinery network and workshop and so on. [name], do you want to say something about

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,360
yourself? What do you do in your daily? Yeah, so it's so nice to be here. I work in Norway.

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,880
In TromsÃ¸, I work on code refinery training, training in software development, software tools,

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:47,920
in computing. In Norway, I work at the national infrastructure. So there is a national compute,

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,420
We have National Compute Courses and I provide support

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,160
and help and training so that researchers

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,420
get more out of their CPU cycles.

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,240
And it's nice to be here with this Finland,

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,120
with this training, which is driven by Aalto,

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,120
because I really like to collaborate with my Aalto colleagues.

34
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,240
we work together on many different training events.

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,200
And also I really like talking about this topic.

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,940
And I think it's very, it doesn't matter

37
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,120
whether this is now Norway or Finland or a different country.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,180
I think some of the,

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,800
some of the points that we will discuss

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,280
are really transferable and they,

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,120
so it will be fun to talk about how we do help TESC

42
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,520
and support in here in Tromso, but also at Aalto

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,680
and how can we improve it?

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,760
How can we improve the experience for everybody?

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,960
And this small change here is that I will be presenting

46
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,080
this together with [name] because [name] has been

47
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,180
heroically restoring the stream in the meantime

48
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,640
and had to switch computer.

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,080
And I will now switch to, so for everybody,

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,440
the best way to follow the next 20 minutes

51
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,680
because we are a little bit behind schedule

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,440
is you can find the slides, the slide deck here.

53
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Is it linked from the schedule?

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,680
It is also linked here in the notes.

55
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,360
And the best way to interact is to watch us presenting

56
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,800
and please ask us lots of questions, give comments.

57
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,800
And [name] will help me raising some questions

58
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
that I might overlook.

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,160
So I will now open up this presentation

60
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,120
And when I do that, I already have it here in this browser.

61
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,560
We'll just resize a little bit,

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
and I will make sure that I can see your questions

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,520
here on the bottom.

64
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,480
So let's talk about how to ask for help

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,160
with computers and supercomputers.

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,620
And it's really about,

67
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,280
the goal is to improve your experience

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,760
when solving issues.

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,240
And some of the topics that I will talk about

70
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,260
is what kind of help is available,

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,880
when to ask for help,

72
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,800
and then how you can formulate your support requests

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,920
so that you get quick and useful answers.

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
And if we have time,

75
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,220
we can talk about reproducible examples

76
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,560
and the value of growing your calculation

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,720
and simplifying problems,

78
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,920
how that can help you find answers quicker.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,360
And the slide deck is, there's credit.

80
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,240
It has, I've learned a lot from other people

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,360
and some of the persons are here

82
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,000
and thanks so much for this input.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
And I would like to start with this question.

84
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,160
There are these many places where you can ask for help

85
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,600
and I can ask [name], if you look for help,

86
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,280
I mean, if you look for a solution,

87
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,800
how do you, like, where do you ask?

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,560
How do you ask?

89
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,040
Yeah, it depends, of course, on the type of issue.

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,240
But maybe I really like that there's people.

91
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,640
So we have this Zulip, which is a system

92
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,800
for chatting together.

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,040
We have one at Aalto, we have one with the Code Refinery.

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,440
So we have dedicated channels when anyone can ask for help.

95
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,800
And when the question is too difficult,

96
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,920
the human is the best, in my opinion.

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,760
What about you?

98
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes, I really like that.

99
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,240
that and I want to highlight here so it can be colleagues also hopefully you have somebody

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:48,120
in the corridor who who knows an answer. There are also these at alto it's called the garage.

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,760
It's a daily help desk session where you can come and ask questions. We have something

102
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:01,280
similar here in terms of weekly office hours. Then we have monthly q&a sessions in Norway.

103
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,680
So hopefully, your, like your compute center provides these sessions.

104
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,440
So it's really nice to, I think, come and talk to a person.

105
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,840
Then there are, I think, very popular these days is to also ask the AI through a chat

106
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,520
interface.

107
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,440
There is documentation issue tracker.

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,080
Resource software engineers who can help you with when it's more about the code rather

109
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,420
but then about the computation

110
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,580
and then mailing this forum stock exchange.

111
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,020
I tried to order them a little bit how they are.

112
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,140
So the ones on the bottom are at least for me

113
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,740
maybe a little bit scarier to ask

114
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,740
because then it's, I asked the question

115
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,340
to the whole internet.

116
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,260
Some people prefer to ask questions more to colleagues.

117
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,460
So many places to ask.

118
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,220
Oh, thanks for highlighting at CSE,

119
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,240
weekly user support sessions.

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,140
So I think these are great initiatives.

121
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,940
Because as I will show later,

122
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,540
sometimes an email is not enough

123
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,900
because in an email, we have to read between the lines.

124
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,600
Sometimes the actual question is not asked

125
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,860
and it can help to really discuss in person.

126
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,920
When to ask for help, don't hesitate, don't wait too long.

127
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,580
Really many people really like helping.

128
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,240
But I can also say that as a support staff, I do appreciate when I see that the person

129
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:38,600
who is writing the email, maybe spent two minutes on the problem before asking.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,920
And not because it's about like my two minutes of work, but it often makes it open often

131
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,040
sharpens the question, it makes it that they think a little bit about about the problem

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
and give me a little bit more context.

133
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,040
Oh yeah, also on Lumi every Wednesday of the month, wonderful.

134
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,680
So please keep these comments coming and the questions I really like that.

135
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
Next slide.

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,320
It's sometimes I give myself a time limit that I tell me that, okay, I will, I will

137
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
try to fix this.

138
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
I will give myself one hour.

139
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,880
And then if it doesn't work, I will go to the garage, open off office hour or user support

140
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,720
session and ask for help there.

141
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,180
And it can be also nice to say like, what, what do you want from the help?

142
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,180
Would you like advice?

143
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,240
Or would you like them to do something for you like to install software or to, to do

144
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:41,380
profiling or do some programming?

145
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,700
Who is on the other side?

146
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,060
So when I send an email, it's good to know that on the other side, there is a human being.

147
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:58,340
Also when I reply to email, and as a reminder to myself, so when I'm staff and helping others,

148
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,980
I want to remind myself, it's not easy to ask for help.

149
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,940
The person who's asking me didn't spend the last 25 years with Unix and Linux.

150
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,860
Maybe the person on the other side has spent weeks on this problem and waited for my answer.

151
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,340
So really, it's important to be respectful.

152
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:30,020
It's good to know for those who ask questions via email, that the support that is helping

153
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,620
and answering these might maybe change every week.

154
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,780
So in Norway, we are rotating.

155
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,700
So every few weeks, there might be different people answering.

156
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,580
I answer these questions, I don't know everything. I might sometimes I feel like I'm spending

157
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,620
less time on the supercomputing supercomputer than the person asking. So very often, I don't

158
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:54,820
know the answer. But I can we can together try to try to find the answer and solve it.

159
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,620
And especially if this is if this is a system with with many users. So on on our systems,

160
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,480
we have something around 2000 users.

161
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,300
How about Alto?

162
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,500
How many users are there?

163
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,060
Yeah, many, at least the cluster is 1,500 more.

164
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,260
So yeah, same levels.

165
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,700
And probably Lumi comparable, CSE comparable,

166
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,540
maybe even more.

167
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,580
And which means that I might not know the person

168
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
who's writing the email.

169
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,740
I might not have the context.

170
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,340
It's good to create this context

171
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,900
when asking through like email chat.

172
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,360
And I remember my first question,

173
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,460
my first ever technical email request

174
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,580
that I wrote to somebody.

175
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,300
So I wrote a long email to a professor,

176
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,340
very respectful, paragraphs and paragraphs.

177
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,660
And what I really wanted is I wanted to get access

178
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,560
to the source code that they used in a publication.

179
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,860
But, and after a while I got this very short email back

180
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,380
And the answer was, hi, I guess what you meant asking

181
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,620
in between all those paragraphs was,

182
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,820
can I please get the code X?

183
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,660
And here it is.

184
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,540
So I got what I wanted,

185
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,100
but I felt a little bit embarrassed

186
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,980
because it was just not clear what I wanted.

187
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,140
I didn't make it clear.

188
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,320
One thing that can help is that in these email requests,

189
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,620
oh, email subject is the first thing that I see

190
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,620
when trying to help, so to make it descriptive.

191
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,220
So if the CML subject is problem, it is not very useful

192
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,980
because then everybody needs to open it up

193
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,240
and see what is inside.

194
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,700
If there is a descriptive subject,

195
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,220
it's easier for us to route the email to the right person.

196
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,780
Sometimes I don't know the answer,

197
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,980
but my colleagues know the answer,

198
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,860
and then I can try, it makes it easier for me

199
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,260
to find the right colleague.

200
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,620
About providing context.

201
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,700
So what are the things that can help us to having this context, like having a username,

202
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,580
if you are one of the 1500 users or 2000 users, I can probably figure it out, but it will

203
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,260
take time.

204
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:23,260
If you talk about storage and location, then it is good to have an explicit path.

205
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:30,160
It's better than saying it is in my home folder or it is in a relative folder because then

206
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,920
it means something else for you than for me and I need to find out.

207
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,080
It takes some time.

208
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:42,240
And if if there are multiple clusters machines, tell us which machine it is, which software

209
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,880
which research field if if relevant.

210
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,500
if you modify your software environment

211
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,220
in a file like .bashrc,

212
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,340
then tell us about it because your .bashrc

213
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,220
where you can have your own customization

214
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,780
is different than mine.

215
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,780
So I might have a different environment.

216
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,620
Good.

217
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,560
It would be nice to have more questions

218
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,060
here in the document.

219
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,500
And speaking about questions,

220
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,780
One thing that is really good to know is

221
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,440
if something doesn't work, tell us, has it ever worked?

222
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,980
So is it the first time that you try this

223
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,620
or has it worked last Tuesday

224
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,400
and today it doesn't work anymore?

225
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,020
That's really useful.

226
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,720
What are you trying to accomplish?

227
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,960
And here, what is your ultimate goal

228
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,820
and not the current technical obstacle?

229
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,680
And I might return to that point.

230
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,740
And what did you do so far?

231
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,900
So try to be specific.

232
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:59,020
Copy paste all the commands, so that I can reproduce it.

233
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,020
And then what do you need?

234
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
Do you need a complete solution?

235
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Do you need advice?

236
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Do you need?

237
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:11,880
It's just that we allocate the right time.

238
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:20,060
It helps me when I see that, like the support email tells me what you have tried, again,

239
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
has it stopped working?

240
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,740
Or has it ever worked?

241
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,460
Does it always fail this way, or only sometimes?

242
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:39,700
And if you have tried to simplify the problem, then tell us how and that that helps a lot.

243
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,220
And please check documentation at web,

244
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,340
but sometimes the web is wrong.

245
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,420
So don't hesitate to ask,

246
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,540
because sometimes the web gives help

247
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,580
on how to solve something on a laptop,

248
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,340
and that doesn't work on a cluster.

249
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,700
And I think what the comment that comes down,

250
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,380
comes here at the bottom is a very good comment,

251
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,380
is that sometimes when you ask a question,

252
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:14,420
you get the feeling that support people are bothered and that's really sad if it's like

253
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:21,940
that. So I think the support hub should always be welcoming and understanding. And it is

254
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:28,980
really sad if through the short electronic communication, it feels like people are distracted

255
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,080
have bothered. I think it is really our one of our main roles is to help research and

256
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:44,560
help you to to solve computational problems. So unfortunately, that's sometimes true. And

257
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:53,680
I think we we here work hard on on improving this. I mentioned that it's good to know what

258
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,600
is your what is your goal, not what is the current technical obstacle. And when we meet

259
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:06,720
in person in during garage and during office hours, it's easier to figure this out. When

260
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,560
when we just send an email, it's sometimes hard because so one famous thing is this so

261
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:19,360
called XY problem where imagine a user wants to solve something wants to do something and

262
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:27,520
then searches the internet. And somewhere finds out that in order to do this, you need

263
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,560
to do this obstacle. The technical obstacle is why. And then, then the user tries this

264
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:45,740
and hits a problem. And then asks for help with this technical obstacle. And then we

265
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:53,340
spend some time or much interaction, a couple of emails back and forth. And after this couple

266
00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:00,420
of interaction, we figure out that this technical obstacle that we solved was not even the suitable

267
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,460
solution. And what the user really wanted to do is x, but it was never written, we didn't

268
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,460
know, we never knew. And if we knew we would have suggested maybe a completely different

269
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:16,800
solution to do this. So it's really good to to say it, what do you really want to do?

270
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:26,760
And I think I will show two examples in a moment.

271
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,600
Maybe good to know what happens with your email when you send it.

272
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,760
So on our side in Norway, and I think it's similar in in other places, when you send

273
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,760
us an email, it opens up something called a ticket and issue it gets a number.

274
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,000
And there we have a place to track it and keep track of it to have a conversation in

275
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,160
it to keep a context. And it's good to know that these tickets issues can change hands.

276
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,080
That's why we need to really document this context. And good, better formulated requests

277
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,520
avoid this lengthy back and forth. And once a problem is resolved, and the ticket or issue

278
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:13,800
gets closed. And I want to show you two, two example requests that they are a little bit

279
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:20,460
redacted but they are real. And we can discuss here with an echo what we like about them.

280
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:28,700
So here's a real request. Hi, I'm a user of some some name on the cluster saga. So that's

281
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,500
a that's a cluster here that we have in Norway. And since this morning, I cannot log in anymore.

282
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:41,900
I have tried to log in into some other clusters, and this works. And I use SSH keys to log

283
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,660
login, and the error that I get since this morning is the following.

284
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,860
And thank you in advance for help advice how to solve this.

285
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,460
So what do we like about this request?

286
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
What is really nice about this?

287
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:02,260
Yeah, I mean, at least I clearly see the problem, the issue, I can already see that the user

288
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:09,300
has tried to do some type of, you know, debugging or whatever you want to call it troubleshooting.

289
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Yeah.

290
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,940
really good context here. Just from this email I can see that I can see what the

291
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,860
user tried. Cannot login anymore but can login on to other clusters

292
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,700
which means that it's probably there is a problem probably since this morning on

293
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,420
the cluster. Just from this email I can see that it's probably not

294
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,900
something on their side. It's something on our side. And there is even an error

295
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,900
message which means that from this I get a really good idea of what it might be

296
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,260
be. And I might be able to solve it in sort of one shot solution. And the next email is

297
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:51,100
says it's solved. And I can see the time. So I can see that we have maybe maximum five

298
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:58,620
minutes left. So to the moderators here, don't worry, I can see that. I want to show one

299
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:06,300
another example, which is also real. And the email that we got was, hi, I'm not sure I

300
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,460
I wrote to the right support line,

301
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,700
but what I'm looking for is a virtual machine

302
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,180
where we can install a PHP web server

303
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,380
with a MySQL database behind it.

304
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,940
And what we have in mind is to set up a service

305
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,420
where we can share the data from our recent study

306
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,900
and the data can be fully public.

307
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,420
It's about 2000 records, so not so much data.

308
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,260
And we would like to create a web front end

309
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,760
where people can search through and plot our data.

310
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,580
and looking forward to hear more, whether this is possible.

311
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,460
What do you like about this one?

312
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,860
Well, I mean, I would say that it looks like

313
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,060
they know what they're doing and what they want to do

314
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,780
because most likely they might be already familiar

315
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,060
with web development and MySQL.

316
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,940
What do you think about this one?

317
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,260
Yeah, so what I like is that they ask

318
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
very specific what they want.

319
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,340
But what I also like is that they give a context

320
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:14,380
of what they what. So really the goal. So here's the technical things. But here is what

321
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,580
they would like to have, they would like to have a web service. I also like that they

322
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:25,260
tell me that it's public data. So immediately, I know I don't have to worry about, it's not

323
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:32,580
something for a sensitive, sensitive data, it's public. Also, I get a good idea of the

324
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,780
the size of it.

325
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,500
So this will probably not be terabytes and petabytes.

326
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,500
And what was good here is that if the question

327
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,220
was just this, we would have done it.

328
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,560
We would have created a virtual machine

329
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,600
and installed exactly what they wanted.

330
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,300
But thanks to this paragraph, we, in this particular case,

331
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,620
we realized that there was a better way of doing it.

332
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,700
And we did something different for them.

333
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
And they are very happy about it.

334
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,700
So we didn't do this because for their example,

335
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,140
we found something that was a better fit.

336
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,880
But since we had this big picture,

337
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,660
we could suggest this other suggestion.

338
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,580
And so we did it, everybody's happy.

339
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,020
And I liked that it was not just the immediate next step,

340
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,320
but it was where do they want to be at the end.

341
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,100
Good, we have very few minutes left.

342
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,260
Would be nice to have more questions here, please keep them coming.

343
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:47,540
I think the last few slides are some recommendations on how you can create examples that you can

344
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,140
share with support to make it easier.

345
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:57,020
And one recommendation that I like to give is that when you are on a new machine, or

346
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,580
you have never been on a cluster before, or something is failing.

347
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,520
It's it's nice if you can start with a small example.

348
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,020
So don't start with a gigantic example with the trends on lots of compute nodes and requires

349
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,400
40 hours to run.

350
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,060
If the same problem can be reproduced with a small example, then it's really useful for

351
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,220
you and it's really useful for the support.

352
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,900
And when I'm on a new system that I don't know well, I like to start with something

353
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,260
that runs in five minutes, maybe on one core.

354
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,660
And then once it works, then I go to more time, more cores, bigger system.

355
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,980
And then then I make my calculation longer.

356
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,920
That really helps me identifying lots of problems early.

357
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,460
And I don't have to wait 40 hours to to figure this out.

358
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:58,580
And then whenever I suggest it, a good comment could be but but wait a bit.

359
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,340
Making a small system is not realistic.

360
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,540
My my realistic system is big and takes long.

361
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,580
And then my advice is that it doesn't have to be realistic.

362
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,620
It can be a synthetic example.

363
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,620
So very simplified, you remove lots of, you make the,

364
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,280
I don't know, smaller resolution, smaller data set,

365
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,380
but it can help us to debug lots of technical issues.

366
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,140
And then once they are sorted out,

367
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,780
then we can go back to the realistic system.

368
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,740
So this is a technique that I really like to use

369
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,660
and it can make it much, much easier to solve problems.

370
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,180
And I think only two, two minutes left.

371
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,940
So I really highly recommend to create

372
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,900
a small reproducible example

373
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,860
for a typical calculation that you run.

374
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,800
Because then when this doesn't work anymore,

375
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,480
you can quickly verify, is this a problem on your side

376
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,860
or is it a problem on the cluster side?

377
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,420
And if it's a problem on the cluster side,

378
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,140
you can send them this small example

379
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,420
and they can run it as well

380
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,040
and use it to diagnose the problem.

381
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,620
If this is an interactive job,

382
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,540
where you type commands and run the job sort of live,

383
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,020
then please provide all commands from login to problem.

384
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,860
Also, this helps us to diagnose and to reproduce

385
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,460
and retrace your steps, step-by-step,

386
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,880
precisely as you did.

387
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:44,000
And the smaller examples, they make it, often they simplify the problem.

388
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,780
They can help identify the reason they reduce the number of freedoms.

389
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
It's easier to debug.

390
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,720
And also it doesn't queue, it doesn't wait in the queue forever if it's smaller.

391
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,080
We as staff, we also have to wait in the queue, like we don't have a prioritized queuing.

392
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,640
So if this is a very long example, it's also long for us.

393
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,920
And I think my time is up.

394
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,980
I think I want to go to the summary slide.

395
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,360
You are not alone.

396
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,360
Approach, support, and resources for engineers near you.

397
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,160
Pop into a garage session or a Q&A help session

398
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,440
or an office hour and say hi.

399
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,400
It's also a great place to not just ask questions

400
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,160
but give suggestions on how we can improve the systems.

401
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,640
You are probably not alone experiencing a problem.

402
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,560
And the questions are never too stupid, too simple.

403
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,640
They are very often good questions.

404
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,760
Many people really enjoy helping.

405
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,040
And the people who organize this discourse,

406
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,000
they really, really enjoy helping and are good at this.

407
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,920
It's also okay from time to time to tell us

408
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,960
if something is working well.

409
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,720
It doesn't happen very often that, you know,

410
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,560
at 2 a.m. in the morning, you get an email

411
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,400
that somebody's thinking,

412
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,400
well, the system is actually working, and thanks.

413
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,760
But good to hear that as well.

414
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,320
And here, the comment.

415
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,400
Yeah, so it can be, you can start with your own team,

416
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,560
start with a colleague,

417
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,640
and then you can escalate, go to other places.

418
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,720
So it can be a progression.

419
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,720
What did we miss? Anything I missed to say?

420
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:45,720
No, I think this was super useful, especially considering that I know that let's say half of the participants who are registered for this session are people who just started with their summer internship.

421
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,720
So asking for help and getting the most out of it is really important when you're just starting.

422
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Wonderful.

423
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,760
Thank you so much [name], this was very useful and regarding the streaming, so the connection

424
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,080
from the streaming server to the rest of the internet is fine again.

425
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:14,920
So I hear from the back room that we should be able to switch to the better streaming

426
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
server.

427
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Good.

428
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
So then thanks everybody for listening.

429
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Thanks a lot.

430
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:23,120
I give back to the studio, and I will look forward to more.

431
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,880
Thank you so much.

432
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,920
So let's see if the streaming goes to the new.

433
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,720
Yeah, hello.

434
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,020
Yeah.

435
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,820
OK.

436
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,360
wait I need to say that for everyone there will be a short break and it will

437
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,880
hopefully be back what is left here
