1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
And welcome back.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,720
So now we are essentially at the next stage and we actually want to connect to our clusters.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,280
The documents or documentation that we have is mainly for Aalto but conceptually it's the

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,920
same for any other cluster.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,280
are plenty of different ways how you can connect to the clusters and we will talk about two of them.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,800
Essentially we will talk about an SSH connection and we will show a bit of the

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,560
on-demand that [name] has already showed in the last session.

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,640
So if I scroll down a bit in the materials there's a long list here but some will exist on your

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,080
cluster and some will not. All of them exist on Aalto, but they show the two main things, I guess.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,440
We will, for demonstration purposes, assume that you have direct internet access to your cluster.

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,360
That means if you are on Aalto, you need to be on the virtual private network because the

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:19,220
Sorry, because the Triton cluster is not directly accessible from the internet except the open

13
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,720
on demand approach.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:31,760
So if you want to follow and want to type along, you will need to be on the VPN.

15
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:39,120
the question came up before what's the difference between the login node and the compute nodes.

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,280
I think this image shows it quite well. So the login node is the element that's connected to

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,000
the net. In this case is the Aalto network. On Lumi or other CSC machines it's directly connected to

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,680
the internet and this machine is essentially your entry point to the cluster this is the machine

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,360
where you submit jobs where you get where you put things uh onto onto the cluster or tell the

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:21,520
cluster okay i want this to be computed um in general why if you want to connect to the cluster

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
the first thing you have to do is you have to get an account i assume that all of the all of

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,000
of you have done that for your respective clusters.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,920
And we will first go through the SSH connection,

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,960
and [name] will demonstrate that.

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,520
OK, so just to be sure, I'll just say again.

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,200
So I'm connected to the, I mean, the Aalto network through the VPN.

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,760
[name]'s, there's notes that [name]'s voice is much louder.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Okay, well, the only easy way I can access that is from here, so just a moment.

29
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,280
Okay, does that change the volume?

30
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,320
[name], can you say something? Does it change it?

31
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,080
I hope it changed our list.

32
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,640
Okay, well.

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I guess we can, we should move on. Yeah, okay, sounds good.

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,200
Okay, so I have a terminal open here and yeah, I am on the Aalto network.

35
00:03:51,200 --> 00:04:09,480
work. That's important. So what do I do? I will use a standard method. I have some setup

36
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,760
here that would make it â€“ I could type a significantly shorter command, but I will

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,820
try to stick to whatever, something that works on whatever system you're on.

38
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,880
So the command is ssh.

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,800
Actually before I do that, why don't I show where I am right now.

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,100
So I can type the command hostname.

41
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,320
That is the name of my laptop.

42
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
That's another laptop.

43
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:53,040
have usually a name that's something like this, starting with an l and with a number.

44
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,960
I can also show my username, and that is, well, that is my username. It's, again, an

45
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,240
Aalto username, so actually you will see the same one on Triton. Maybe it would have been

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,080
more interesting to see it change, but, well, if you're going from an Aalto machine, you

47
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,560
always have the same username.

48
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,600
Okay. So I am on this machine and now I will type the command.

49
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,320
So username, add,

50
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,440
and then the name of the machine.

51
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,760
So that's triton.aalto.fi.

52
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,460
The important bit here is it's

53
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,520
the username that you have on the system that you want to connect.

54
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,800
Yes.

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,860
And you seemingly already have set up SSH keys.

56
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
Yes, that is true.

57
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,480
If you, I'm on the VPN,

58
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,760
right, it didn't ask for a password, correct, yes.

59
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,960
So should we demonstrate again

60
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,780
what it looks like if you haven't set it up?

61
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,080
There's not a big change.

62
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,000
The main difference is that you will be asked

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,640
for your password on the machine.

64
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,360
And there are actually systems like Lumi

65
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,080
where you have to have a ssh keys being set up.

66
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,980
Otherwise you can't.

67
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,040
So I think the biggest difference,

68
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
I think that people will see,

69
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
well, there is that it will ask for a password.

70
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,680
It will, if it's the first time connecting

71
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,080
to a new server, so a new machine,

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,520
it will also ask you, it will print this key

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,320
That's essentially a random string of characters and it will ask you if that is the correct

74
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,320
one.

75
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,360
So if you're connecting to something for the first time, it's pretty much safe to just

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
type in yes.

77
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,440
You can check it somewhere.

78
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
You can check that it's correct.

79
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Yeah.

80
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,760
I will put that into the document, at least for Triton.

81
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,160
So, I will go to the shared document.

82
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,200
For essentially any HPC service,

83
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,280
there will be a page where the SSH key fingerprints

84
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,800
are being listed.

85
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,920
And you can check whether what's being shown to you

86
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,980
will be, or is the same as what's listed on there.

87
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,800
And if it is, then you are connecting to the correct.

88
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,640
Yeah, so this, having this key on the system

89
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,640
essentially proves that it is the right machine.

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Nobody's trying to fake Triton.

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,980
You are actually in the actual correct Triton machine.

92
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,520
The main thing though is,

93
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,020
because when you're connecting for the first time,

94
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,120
it will just send it to you

95
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,580
and your machine has nothing to compare it to.

96
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,040
So it will ask you to accept it.

97
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,320
From then on, if it ever changes,

98
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,680
your machine will either just refuse to connect,

99
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,840
or it will at least ask you to check what's going on.

100
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,920
And it refuses the connection and tells you,

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,800
yeah, you can remove the old key there.

102
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,160
But that's the point where checking

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,840
whether the keys have actually changed makes sense.

104
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,680
Yes.

105
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,440
So if the key changes, it's either something really drastic

106
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,040
has happened, like we have a new version of Triton

107
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,880
something. It's a completely new machine or someone is actually doing an attack and trying

108
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,360
to get you to lock into the wrong system. So if it complains about this, it is a good thing to check

109
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:52,000
but usually it doesn't. But essentially this is how you connect via SSH. Yes. There's really

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,720
not much more to it. Actually, now in the prompt you do have the name of the machine. It's login4.

111
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:09,360
You do have my username. We can type hostname and see. It's login4.triton.aalto.fi and

112
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,880
who am I again? It's the same as before unfortunately, but well that is my username on Aalto.

113
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Okay, well, are we going to do anything more here?

114
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
I guess not much.

115
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,880
We will, of course, be using the machine much more in the next two days.

116
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Yeah.

117
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
Okay.

118
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Okay, then for the on-demand, which...

119
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
So this is in the browser.

120
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,720
Yeah, this is a way that is quite convenient as well, depending on what you want to do.

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,120
So essentially, you go to the page that [name] had shown earlier, which is on-demand.

122
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,400
Yes, so there is a, well, first of all,

123
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,760
there's instructions for connecting with SSH.

124
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,760
And then there is a link to ondemand.triton.aalto.fi.

125
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
It's relatively easy to remember or bookmark.

126
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Let's go there.

127
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,760
I didn't actually want to close the materials, so I'll open it back up.

128
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Okay, so this is what the Triton Open On Demand looks like.

129
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm already signed in.

130
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
I'm already logged in.

131
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,760
It will ask you to log in with your Aldo credentials.

132
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,760
which you have seen many times already.

133
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
It's using a standard multi-factor authentication for that.

134
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,760
So, in here you have multiple different things that you can do.

135
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,760
One thing, or the most convenient thing to use is the Triton Shell access,

136
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
which is essentially another...

137
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Shell, this will do exactly the same thing as SSH, except in the browser.

138
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,260
browser.

139
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,460
Except in the browser.

140
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,080
So you don't even need to type in any passwords

141
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,180
because it already has your credentials.

142
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,340
So that's kind of convenient if you just

143
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,660
want to throw in a few commands and you haven't set up

144
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,460
the command line in more detail.

145
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,180
And this works from outside Aalto.

146
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,700
But you do need to log in in the browser

147
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,500
with the two-factor authentication.

148
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
Yep.

149
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,260
The second thing is something that [name] has already shown.

150
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,100
Essentially, the Triton desktop.

151
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,820
This is for any graphical applications.

152
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,220
It could also be if you have some software that

153
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,380
has a simple graphical installer,

154
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,300
you could essentially just request the session

155
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,060
and run it there and see if it installs

156
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,260
or if it's missing things.

157
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,300
If it installs and it's a graphical tool,

158
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,900
you might encounter some issues running things later on

159
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,780
if you're not running it via Triton desktop,

160
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,380
because the desktop does load a couple of libraries that

161
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,980
are only available on some of the nodes.

162
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,300
Because as mentioned earlier, we want

163
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,580
to keep the nodes themselves as nimble as possible

164
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,460
so that they are not wasting resources

165
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,220
and there are only a limited amount of things now.

166
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,180
So I have access now, so I can click through here.

167
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,500
There are, well, one or two things

168
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
that we might want to show.

169
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,900
So if you work with Chrome, Chrome

170
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:57,580
has the option to share the clipboard with the browser,

171
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,260
which is quite convenient.

172
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,780
If you have a browser that doesn't support that,

173
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,340
you have this thing on the side where you also

174
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,540
have a clipboard.

175
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,980
I'm going to copy the address from here,

176
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,260
so that it should now be on the clipboard.

177
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,020
And indeed, because I am on Chrome,

178
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,660
it is here on the clipboard.

179
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,980
But if it's not, you can paste it in,

180
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:30,540
and then you have it in a clipboard of this remote system,

181
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,680
this Triton session.

182
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,980
Might be a convenient thing if you, as I said, want to install some software and have a license

183
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:44,100
key or something like that, you can essentially copy-paste that via this method.

184
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:54,300
Otherwise, if you're used to the Linux desktop environments, this is very familiar.

185
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,740
And in general, it's of course very similar to any desktop environment.

186
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,620
I can also open a terminal from here or run any other software.

187
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,660
Of course, running a terminal from here is not necessarily the easiest way of accessing

188
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,380
a terminal in Triton.

189
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:19,340
Now I'm actually on a compute node, which is an interesting difference to the previous

190
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
one.

191
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,340
Yeah.

192
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,060
So, this is not the login node.

193
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,420
We can do more stuff here.

194
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,080
You are essentially only restricted by the amount of resources that you have requested

195
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,040
when you were requesting this session.

196
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:43,320
And there's one third thing that I think is worth mentioning on this on-demand, and that's

197
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,520
a relatively easy way to transfer files.

198
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,880
So we go out of the desktop.

199
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,320
I don't know if logging out is very important.

200
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Can I go and delete it?

201
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,680
You can go and delete it from here as well.

202
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,240
Yeah.

203
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,000
Yeah.

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,320
If on demand, you go to this files thing.

205
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
Yes.

206
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,020
[name] has access to a couple of projects, obviously.

207
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,960
Normally, you only have your home directory,

208
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,700
your work directory, and potentially additional projects

209
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,240
that you are a member of.

210
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,040
And that is a relatively convenient method to at least upload smaller files and smaller things.

211
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,480
If we are getting into the gigabyte range, I would personally recommend to use the command

212
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:47,280
line and things like rsync or similar. But for smaller files, using this file browsing

213
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,280
utility for uploading and downloading is absolutely fine.

214
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:01,760
So, that's kind of the two approaches that you can, or the approaches that you can use.

215
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,600
On the command line, you have everything that you have on a command line.

216
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:15,740
On OOD, you are somewhat restricted with the connection to your machine by what things

217
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
can be transferred.

218
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,640
And, for example, on the Triton desktop, there's no copy-paste of files.

219
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
Right.

220
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:31,400
You cannot very easily move a file between the whatever laptop you're working on and Triton

221
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,120
from there. But you can go through the files menu here and just upload it there and it will

222
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,640
show up on the Triton desktop in the folder that you placed it in.

223
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,080
So there are also several applications that are pre-installed here.

224
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:56,640
So, Jupyter, RStudio, Paraview, you know if you want to use them.

225
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:04,920
And Speech2Text, for example, is for translating, well, spoken word into text.

226
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,360
So that might be very useful for you.

227
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,920
That's purely auto.

228
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:25,220
So yeah, so different clusters will have different ways of accessing, but many of them do have

229
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:31,920
some sort of way, this online system, something very similar to Open On Demand.

230
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,480
Let's see, other questions.

231
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,000
So the point of the rest of this session is to get connected.

232
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,320
And if you have questions, problems, feel free to ask.

233
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,400
There is also the help Zoom session.

234
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,160
If you are signed up, you should have received a link.

235
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,800
There's one question that's already mainly answered, but what if you forget to close

236
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,880
the desktop?

237
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:13,200
What I would like to add to the answer that's in the HackMD is,

238
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,620
you are essentially built for your time,

239
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,200
but not in the sense that you're paying money for it.

240
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,420
You're paying in priority, i.e.,

241
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,200
how fast you get resources if the resources are in high demand.

242
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
If you leave something running while it could be closed,

243
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,600
you might have to wait longer for resources in the future.

244
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,520
So there is this in jobs,

245
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,500
you have this active jobs.

246
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,420
I don't have any active jobs,

247
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,900
but that's one way to find what you have running.

248
00:18:51,900 --> 00:19:00,680
Actually, how do I get to the view where I had all of my old jobs as well?

249
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,840
Well I mean there was a big red button to delete the job. I mean that will only delete it from the

250
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,000
list but if you see a running job there, there will be a button. I think it's a big red button

251
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,720
to close that job. So if you close a tab and your desktop is still running, you can always go and

252
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:27,000
close the job from there. I think you can always do it. You can also find it in here if it's still

253
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,920
running. And you can close it. Anything else?

254
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,680
Okay, it's the big picture. Okay, so our goal is, so there's lots of stuff that

255
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,480
can happen here, and you saw a lot of demos. For tomorrow, what do people need

256
00:19:50,480 --> 00:20:02,640
know how to do. Well, the main thing is to connect to the cluster in some way. So, find a way to get

257
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:12,880
a terminal running on Triton or on your local cluster. So, either SSH into it or find a way

258
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:24,080
accessing it through a browser either on-demand or similar and open a terminal from there.

259
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:34,560
So the main thing probably would be though to use SSH to access it and there's instructions

260
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,520
here for different operating systems that may be slightly different, a few options for

261
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:52,560
Windows, but Windows nowadays has just SSH built in to the command line interface, so it's actually

262
00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:02,880
pretty much the same as on Linux and on macOS. So yeah, at least as far as I know, the main thing is

263
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:11,040
to get access to the cluster, get a terminal running on the cluster, and it's nice if

264
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,840
you can check out what other features your cluster has and try them out. So if you're on Triton,

265
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:26,160
try OpenOnDemand, see what you like there and how you like to use it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And

266
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,360
you don't need this after this break, but you need it by tomorrow. So there's plenty of time to

267
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:39,840
keep figuring stuff out and to ask for support tomorrow morning and all that.

268
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:58,040
And so do keep asking stuff in the notes, and we will take a break now until the next hour, so 3 o'clock finish time or 35 minutes away from now.

269
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:07,040
You might come back a bit early, but if you can log in, go take a break and come back. Don't sit here waiting for us.

270
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Okay.

271
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Okay.

272
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,040
If that's all, I'll talk to you later.

273
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Bye.

274
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Bye.

275
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Bye.

276
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
Bye.
