1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:08,040
But anyway, let's get to the business. We have now here with us [name], who is the master

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,080
of everything. Well, master is maybe a big word, but at least one of the biggest drivers of the

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,920
Code Refinery network and workshop and so on. [name], do you want to say something about

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,360
yourself? What do you do in your daily? Yeah, so it's so nice to be here. I work in Norway.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,880
In TromsÃ¸, I work on code refinery training, training in software development, software tools,

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:44,920
in computing. In Norway, I work at the national infrastructure. So there is a national compute,

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,420
We have National Compute Courses and I provide support

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,160
and help and training so that researchers

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,420
get more out of their CPU cycles.

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,240
And it's nice to be here with this Finland,

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,120
with this training, which is driven by Aalto,

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,120
because I really like to collaborate with my Aalto colleagues.

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,240
we work together on many different training events.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,200
And also I really like talking about this topic.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,940
And I think it's very, it doesn't matter

16
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,120
whether this is now Norway or Finland or a different country.

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,180
I think some of the,

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,800
some of the points that we will discuss

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,280
are really transferable and they,

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,120
so it will be fun to talk about how we do help TESC

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,520
and support in here in Tromso, but also at Aalto

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,680
and how can we improve it?

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,760
How can we improve the experience for everybody?

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,960
And this small change here is that I will be presenting

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,080
this together with [name] because [name] has been

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,180
heroically restoring the stream in the meantime

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,640
and had to switch computer.

28
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,080
And I will now switch to, so for everybody,

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,440
the best way to follow the next 20 minutes

30
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,680
because we are a little bit behind schedule

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,440
is you can find the slides, the slide deck here.

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,360
Is it linked from the schedule?

33
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
It is also linked here in the notes.

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,360
And the best way to interact is to watch us presenting

35
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,800
and please ask us lots of questions, give comments.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,800
And [name] will help me raising some questions

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,680
that I might overlook.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
So I will now open up this presentation

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,120
And when I do that, I already have it here in this browser.

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,560
We'll just resize a little bit,

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
and I will make sure that I can see your questions

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
here on the bottom.

43
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,480
So let's talk about how to ask for help

44
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,160
with computers and supercomputers.

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,620
And it's really about,

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,280
the goal is to improve your experience

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,760
when solving issues.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,240
And some of the topics that I will talk about

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,260
is what kind of help is available,

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,880
when to ask for help,

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,800
and then how you can formulate your support requests

52
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,920
so that you get quick and useful answers.

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,760
And if we have time,

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,220
we can talk about reproducible examples

55
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,560
and the value of growing your calculation

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,720
and simplifying problems,

57
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,920
how that can help you find answers quicker.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,360
And the slide deck is, there's credit.

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,240
It has, I've learned a lot from other people

60
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,360
and some of the persons are here

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,000
and thanks so much for this input.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,200
And I would like to start with this question.

63
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,160
There are these many places where you can ask for help

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,600
and I can ask [name], if you look for help,

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,280
I mean, if you look for a solution,

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,800
how do you, like, where do you ask?

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,560
How do you ask?

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Yeah, it depends, of course, on the type of issue.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,240
But maybe I really like that there's people.

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,640
So we have this Zulip, which is a system

71
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,800
for chatting together.

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,040
We have one at Aalto, we have one with the Code Refinery.

73
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,440
So we have dedicated channels when anyone can ask for help.

74
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,800
And when the question is too difficult,

75
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,920
the human is the best, in my opinion.

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
What about you?

77
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,800
Yes, I really like that.

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
that and I want to highlight here so it can be colleagues also hopefully you have somebody

79
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,120
in the corridor who who knows an answer. There are also these at Aalto it's called the garage.

80
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,760
It's a daily help desk session where you can come and ask questions. We have something

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:58,280
similar here in terms of weekly office hours. Then we have monthly q&a sessions in Norway.

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,680
So hopefully, your, like your compute center provides these sessions.

83
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,440
So it's really nice to, I think, come and talk to a person.

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,840
Then there are, I think, very popular these days is to also ask the AI through a chat

85
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
interface.

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,440
There is documentation issue tracker.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Resource software engineers who can help you with when it's more about the code rather

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,420
but then about the computation

89
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,580
and then mailing this forum stock exchange.

90
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,020
I tried to order them a little bit how they are.

91
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,140
So the ones on the bottom are at least for me

92
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,740
maybe a little bit scarier to ask

93
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,740
because then it's, I asked the question

94
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,340
to the whole internet.

95
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,260
Some people prefer to ask questions more to colleagues.

96
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,460
So many places to ask.

97
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,220
Oh, thanks for highlighting at CSC,

98
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,240
weekly user support sessions.

99
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,140
So I think these are great initiatives.

100
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,940
Because as I will show later,

101
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,540
sometimes an email is not enough

102
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,900
because in an email, we have to read between the lines.

103
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,600
Sometimes the actual question is not asked

104
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,860
and it can help to really discuss in person.

105
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,920
When to ask for help, don't hesitate, don't wait too long.

106
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,580
Really many people really like helping.

107
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,240
But I can also say that as a support staff, I do appreciate when I see that the person

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,600
who is writing the email, maybe spent two minutes on the problem before asking.

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,920
And not because it's about like my two minutes of work, but it often makes it open often

110
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,040
sharpens the question, it makes it that they think a little bit about about the problem

111
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,760
and give me a little bit more context.

112
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:55,040
Oh yeah, also on Lumi every Wednesday of the month, wonderful.

113
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,680
So please keep these comments coming and the questions I really like that.

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Next slide.

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:08,320
It's sometimes I give myself a time limit that I tell me that, okay, I will, I will

116
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
try to fix this.

117
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,720
I will give myself one hour.

118
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,880
And then if it doesn't work, I will go to the garage, open off office hour or user support

119
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,720
session and ask for help there.

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,180
And it can be also nice to say like, what, what do you want from the help?

121
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Would you like advice?

122
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,240
Or would you like them to do something for you like to install software or to, to do

123
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,380
profiling or do some programming?

124
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,700
Who is on the other side?

125
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,060
So when I send an email, it's good to know that on the other side, there is a human being.

126
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:55,340
Also when I reply to email, and as a reminder to myself, so when I'm staff and helping others,

127
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,980
I want to remind myself, it's not easy to ask for help.

128
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:05,940
The person who's asking me didn't spend the last 25 years with Unix and Linux.

129
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,860
Maybe the person on the other side has spent weeks on this problem and waited for my answer.

130
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,340
So really, it's important to be respectful.

131
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:27,020
It's good to know for those who ask questions via email, that the support that is helping

132
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,620
and answering these might maybe change every week.

133
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,780
So in Norway, we are rotating.

134
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,700
So every few weeks, there might be different people answering.

135
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,580
I answer these questions, I don't know everything. I might sometimes I feel like I'm spending

136
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,620
less time on the supercomputing supercomputer than the person asking. So very often, I don't

137
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,820
know the answer. But I can we can together try to try to find the answer and solve it.

138
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,620
And especially if this is if this is a system with with many users. So on on our systems,

139
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,480
we have something around 2000 users.

140
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,300
How about Aalto?

141
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,500
How many users are there?

142
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,060
Yeah, many, at least the cluster is 1,500 more.

143
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
So yeah, same levels.

144
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,700
And probably Lumi comparable, CSC comparable,

145
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,540
maybe even more.

146
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,580
And which means that I might not know the person

147
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,580
who's writing the email.

148
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,740
I might not have the context.

149
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,340
It's good to create this context

150
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,900
when asking through like email chat.

151
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,360
And I remember my first question,

152
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,460
my first ever technical email request

153
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,580
that I wrote to somebody.

154
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,300
So I wrote a long email to a professor,

155
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,340
very respectful, paragraphs and paragraphs.

156
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,660
And what I really wanted is I wanted to get access

157
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,560
to the source code that they used in a publication.

158
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,860
But, and after a while I got this very short email back

159
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,380
And the answer was, hi, I guess what you meant asking

160
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,620
in between all those paragraphs was,

161
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,820
can I please get the code ex?

162
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,660
And here it is.

163
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,540
So I got what I wanted,

164
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,100
but I felt a little bit embarrassed

165
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,980
because it was just not clear what I wanted.

166
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,140
I didn't make it clear.

167
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,320
One thing that can help is that in these email requests,

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,620
oh, email subject is the first thing that I see

169
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,620
when trying to help, so to make it descriptive.

170
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,220
So if the CML subject is problem, it is not very useful

171
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,980
because then everybody needs to open it up

172
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,240
and see what is inside.

173
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,700
If there is a descriptive subject,

174
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,220
it's easier for us to route the email to the right person.

175
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,780
Sometimes I don't know the answer,

176
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,980
but my colleagues know the answer,

177
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,860
and then I can try, it makes it easier for me

178
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,260
to find the right colleague.

179
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,620
About providing context.

180
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,700
So what are the things that can help us to having this context, like having a username,

181
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:08,580
if you are one of the 1500 users or 2000 users, I can probably figure it out, but it will

182
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,260
take time.

183
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:20,260
If you talk about storage and location, then it is good to have an explicit path.

184
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:27,160
It's better than saying it is in my home folder or it is in a relative folder because then

185
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,920
it means something else for you than for me and I need to find out.

186
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,080
It takes some time.

187
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:39,240
And if if there are multiple clusters machines, tell us which machine it is, which software

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,880
which research field if if relevant.

189
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,500
if you modify your software environment

190
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,220
in a file like .bashrc,

191
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,340
then tell us about it because your .bashrc

192
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,220
where you can have your own customization

193
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,780
is different than mine.

194
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
So I might have a different environment.

195
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,620
Good.

196
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,560
It would be nice to have more questions

197
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,060
here in the document.

198
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,500
And speaking about questions,

199
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,780
One thing that is really good to know is

200
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:20,440
if something doesn't work, tell us, has it ever worked?

201
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,980
So is it the first time that you try this

202
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,620
or has it worked last Tuesday

203
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,400
and today it doesn't work anymore?

204
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,020
That's really useful.

205
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,720
What are you trying to accomplish?

206
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,960
And here, what is your ultimate goal

207
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,820
and not the current technical obstacle?

208
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,680
And I might return to that point.

209
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,740
And what did you do so far?

210
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,900
So try to be specific.

211
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,020
Copy paste all the commands, so that I can reproduce it.

212
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
And then what do you need?

213
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
Do you need a complete solution?

214
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
Do you need advice?

215
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,020
Do you need?

216
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:08,880
It's just that we allocate the right time.

217
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:17,060
It helps me when I see that, like the support email tells me what you have tried, again,

218
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
has it stopped working?

219
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,740
Or has it ever worked?

220
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,460
Does it always fail this way, or only sometimes?

221
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:36,700
And if you have tried to simplify the problem, then tell us how and that that helps a lot.

222
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,220
And please check documentation at web,

223
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,340
but sometimes the web is wrong.

224
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,420
So don't hesitate to ask,

225
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,540
because sometimes the web gives help

226
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,580
on how to solve something on a laptop,

227
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,340
and that doesn't work on a cluster.

228
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,700
And I think what the comment that comes down,

229
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,380
comes here at the bottom is a very good comment,

230
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,380
is that sometimes when you ask a question,

231
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:11,420
you get the feeling that support people are bothered and that's really sad if it's like

232
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,940
that. So I think the support hub should always be welcoming and understanding. And it is

233
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,980
really sad if through the short electronic communication, it feels like people are distracted

234
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:32,080
have bothered. I think it is really our one of our main roles is to help research and

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:41,560
help you to to solve computational problems. So unfortunately, that's sometimes true. And

236
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:50,680
I think we we here work hard on on improving this. I mentioned that it's good to know what

237
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,600
is your what is your goal, not what is the current technical obstacle. And when we meet

238
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:03,720
in person in during garage and during office hours, it's easier to figure this out. When

239
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,560
when we just send an email, it's sometimes hard because so one famous thing is this so

240
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,360
called XY problem where imagine a user wants to solve something wants to do something and

241
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:24,520
then searches the internet. And somewhere finds out that in order to do this, you need

242
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:33,560
to do this obstacle. The technical obstacle is why. And then, then the user tries this

243
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:42,740
and hits a problem. And then asks for help with this technical obstacle. And then we

244
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:50,340
spend some time or much interaction, a couple of emails back and forth. And after this couple

245
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:57,420
of interaction, we figure out that this technical obstacle that we solved was not even the suitable

246
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,460
solution. And what the user really wanted to do is x, but it was never written, we didn't

247
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,460
know, we never knew. And if we knew we would have suggested maybe a completely different

248
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:13,800
solution to do this. So it's really good to to say it, what do you really want to do?

249
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:23,760
And I think I will show two examples in a moment.

250
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,600
Maybe good to know what happens with your email when you send it.

251
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,760
So on our side in Norway, and I think it's similar in in other places, when you send

252
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,760
us an email, it opens up something called a ticket and issue it gets a number.

253
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,000
And there we have a place to track it and keep track of it to have a conversation in

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,160
it to keep a context. And it's good to know that these tickets issues can change hands.

255
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,080
That's why we need to really document this context. And good, better formulated requests

256
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,520
avoid this lengthy back and forth. And once a problem is resolved, and the ticket or issue

257
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:10,800
gets closed. And I want to show you two, two example requests that they are a little bit

258
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:17,460
redacted but they are real. And we can discuss here with an echo what we like about them.

259
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:25,700
So here's a real request. Hi, I'm a user of some some name on the cluster saga. So that's

260
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,500
a that's a cluster here that we have in Norway. And since this morning, I cannot log in anymore.

261
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:38,900
I have tried to log in into some other clusters, and this works. And I use SSH keys to log

262
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,660
login, and the error that I get since this morning is the following.

263
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,860
And thank you in advance for help advice how to solve this.

264
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,460
So what do we like about this request?

265
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
What is really nice about this?

266
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:59,260
Yeah, I mean, at least I clearly see the problem, the issue, I can already see that the user

267
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:06,300
has tried to do some type of, you know, debugging or whatever you want to call it troubleshooting.

268
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Yeah.

269
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,940
really good context here. Just from this email I can see that I can see what the

270
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:18,860
user tried. Cannot login anymore but can login on to other clusters

271
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,700
which means that it's probably there is a problem probably since this morning on

272
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,420
the cluster. Just from this email I can see that it's probably not

273
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,900
something on their side. It's something on our side. And there is even an error

274
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,900
message which means that from this I get a really good idea of what it might be

275
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,260
be. And I might be able to solve it in sort of one shot solution. And the next email is

276
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,100
says it's solved. And I can see the time. So I can see that we have maybe maximum five

277
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,620
minutes left. So to the moderators here, don't worry, I can see that. I want to show one

278
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:03,300
another example, which is also real. And the email that we got was, hi, I'm not sure I

279
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,460
I wrote to the right support line,

280
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,700
but what I'm looking for is a virtual machine

281
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,180
where we can install a PHP web server

282
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,380
with a MySQL database behind it.

283
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,940
And what we have in mind is to set up a service

284
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,420
where we can share the data from our recent study

285
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,900
and the data can be fully public.

286
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,420
It's about 2000 records, so not so much data.

287
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,260
And we would like to create a web front end

288
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,760
where people can search through and plot our data.

289
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,580
and looking forward to hear more, whether this is possible.

290
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,460
What do you like about this one?

291
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,860
Well, I mean, I would say that it looks like

292
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,060
they know what they're doing and what they want to do

293
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,780
because most likely they might be already familiar

294
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,060
with web development and MySQL.

295
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,940
What do you think about this one?

296
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,260
Yeah, so what I like is that they ask

297
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,260
very specific what they want.

298
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,340
But what I also like is that they give a context

299
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:11,380
of what they what. So really the goal. So here's the technical things. But here is what

300
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,580
they would like to have, they would like to have a web service. I also like that they

301
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:22,260
tell me that it's public data. So immediately, I know I don't have to worry about, it's not

302
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:29,580
something for a sensitive, sensitive data, it's public. Also, I get a good idea of the

303
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,780
the size of it.

304
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,500
So this will probably not be terabytes and petabytes.

305
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,500
And what was good here is that if the question

306
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,220
was just this, we would have done it.

307
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,560
We would have created a virtual machine

308
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,600
and installed exactly what they wanted.

309
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,300
But thanks to this paragraph, we, in this particular case,

310
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,620
we realized that there was a better way of doing it.

311
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,700
And we did something different for them.

312
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
And they are very happy about it.

313
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,700
So we didn't do this because for their example,

314
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,140
we found something that was a better fit.

315
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,880
But since we had this big picture,

316
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,660
we could suggest this other suggestion.

317
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,580
And so we did it, everybody's happy.

318
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,020
And I liked that it was not just the immediate next step,

319
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,320
but it was where do they want to be at the end.

320
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,100
Good, we have very few minutes left.

321
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:35,260
Would be nice to have more questions here, please keep them coming.

322
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:44,540
I think the last few slides are some recommendations on how you can create examples that you can

323
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,140
share with support to make it easier.

324
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,020
And one recommendation that I like to give is that when you are on a new machine, or

325
00:21:54,020 --> 00:22:00,580
you have never been on a cluster before, or something is failing.

326
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,520
It's it's nice if you can start with a small example.

327
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,020
So don't start with a gigantic example with the trends on lots of compute nodes and requires

328
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,400
40 hours to run.

329
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,060
If the same problem can be reproduced with a small example, then it's really useful for

330
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,220
you and it's really useful for the support.

331
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,900
And when I'm on a new system that I don't know well, I like to start with something

332
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,260
that runs in five minutes, maybe on one core.

333
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,660
And then once it works, then I go to more time, more cores, bigger system.

334
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,980
And then then I make my calculation longer.

335
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,920
That really helps me identifying lots of problems early.

336
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,460
And I don't have to wait 40 hours to to figure this out.

337
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:55,580
And then whenever I suggest it, a good comment could be but but wait a bit.

338
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,340
Making a small system is not realistic.

339
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,540
My my realistic system is big and takes long.

340
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,580
And then my advice is that it doesn't have to be realistic.

341
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,620
It can be a synthetic example.

342
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,620
So very simplified, you remove lots of, you make the,

343
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,280
I don't know, smaller resolution, smaller data set,

344
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,380
but it can help us to debug lots of technical issues.

345
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,140
And then once they are sorted out,

346
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,780
then we can go back to the realistic system.

347
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,740
So this is a technique that I really like to use

348
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,660
and it can make it much, much easier to solve problems.

349
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,180
And I think only two, two minutes left.

350
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,940
So I really highly recommend to create

351
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,900
a small reproducible example

352
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,860
for a typical calculation that you run.

353
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,800
Because then when this doesn't work anymore,

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,480
you can quickly verify, is this a problem on your side

355
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,860
or is it a problem on the cluster side?

356
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,420
And if it's a problem on the cluster side,

357
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,140
you can send them this small example

358
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,420
and they can run it as well

359
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,040
and use it to diagnose the problem.

360
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,620
If this is an interactive job,

361
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,540
where you type commands and run the job sort of live,

362
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,020
then please provide all commands from login to problem.

363
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,860
Also, this helps us to diagnose and to reproduce

364
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,460
and retrace your steps, step-by-step,

365
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,880
precisely as you did.

366
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:41,000
And the smaller examples, they make it, often they simplify the problem.

367
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,780
They can help identify the reason they reduce the number of freedoms.

368
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
It's easier to debug.

369
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:55,720
And also it doesn't queue, it doesn't wait in the queue forever if it's smaller.

370
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,080
We as staff, we also have to wait in the queue, like we don't have a prioritized queuing.

371
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,640
So if this is a very long example, it's also long for us.

372
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,920
And I think my time is up.

373
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,980
I think I want to go to the summary slide.

374
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,360
You are not alone.

375
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,360
Approach, support, and resources for engineers near you.

376
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Pop into a garage session or a Q&A help session

377
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,440
or an office hour and say hi.

378
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,400
It's also a great place to not just ask questions

379
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,160
but give suggestions on how we can improve the systems.

380
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,640
You are probably not alone experiencing a problem.

381
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,560
And the questions are never too stupid, too simple.

382
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,640
They are very often good questions.

383
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,760
Many people really enjoy helping.

384
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,040
And the people who organize this discourse,

385
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,000
they really, really enjoy helping and are good at this.

386
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,920
It's also okay from time to time to tell us

387
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,960
if something is working well.

388
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,720
It doesn't happen very often that, you know,

389
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,560
at 2 a.m. in the morning, you get an email

390
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,400
that somebody's thinking,

391
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
well, the system is actually working, and thanks.

392
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,760
But good to hear that as well.

393
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,320
And here, the comment.

394
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,400
Yeah, so it can be, you can start with your own team,

395
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,560
start with a colleague,

396
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,640
and then you can escalate, go to other places.

397
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,720
So it can be a progression.

398
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,720
What did we miss? Anything I missed to say?

399
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:42,720
No, I think this was super useful, especially considering that I know that let's say half of the participants who are registered for this session are people who just started with their summer internship.

400
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,720
So asking for help and getting the most out of it is really important when you're just starting.

401
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Wonderful.

402
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:57,760
Thank you so much [name], this was very useful and regarding the streaming, so the connection

403
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,080
from the streaming server to the rest of the internet is fine again.

404
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:11,920
So I hear from the back room that we should be able to switch to the better streaming

405
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
server.

406
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Good.

407
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
So then thanks everybody for listening.

408
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Thanks a lot.

409
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,000
I give back to the studio, and I will look forward to more.
