2.7 Monitoring jobs (summary) - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

In order to use large amounts of resources, you need to be able to monitor how many resources you used, so that you can properly adjust the resources you request later.  We go over the main parts: output during the job, time, memory efficiency, CPU efficiency, GPU efficiency, and so on.

We have already seen most of the content there, but we summarize everything now in one place.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
