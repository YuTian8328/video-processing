2.8 Applications, Modules, Data, Remote data - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

We give a lightning overview of four topics: applications (how to get software to run), modules (how some software is made available), data storage (there are many options, and each with a different trade-off: you do need to know these), and how to access data remotely and transfer it.  Each of these could easily take much longer time, but we only go over the high-level and then let you read on your own time.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
