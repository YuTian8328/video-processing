1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Just say one two three.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:12,920
test we started. Sorry, I didn't give the countdown. Hi. So, we're here. I guess the

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,000
first order of business is adding some icebreakers here.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, let's do that.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll add the audio test.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Me then [name].

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
One.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Two.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Three.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Four.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay. Five.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Six.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I was listening to the audio and it was pretty confusing to hear.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Which number should I say?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There's some icebreakers.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So, what can we...

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, one question I would have for our audience is that, have you used an HPC system before?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Like a computational cluster?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And let's say we have questions of never, occasionally, and then.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:02:00,320
one and something completely fun.

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,640
I always remember this question,

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
what was your favorite fruit that got some of

28
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,480
the best response from anything.

29
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,440
What's your favorite ice cream flavor?

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,200
In honor of the weather the last few days.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,600
That's a good question.

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,760
I would say maybe like an old-timey strawberry

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,560
with some jam inside of it or something like that.

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,320
That's pretty good.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Yeah.

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
What's yours?

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,160
Oh, that's a good question.

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:49,520
There's this, um, maito flavor from Suomen Jäätelötehdäs, that's pretty good.

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Yeah.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,920
So for the, how long have you used computers?

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,040
One of my interesting questions there, like, how did you get started and what did it mean

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
to you?

43
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,000
Like when I was growing up there were computers in our home and I mean I guess my parents had

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,880
one of course this was in the 90s or something like that so it wasn't really a powerful commonly

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:26,760
used thing but I didn't really like have a feeling that this is a thing that I could learn about and

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:36,560
know about until maybe my last year of high school, something like that, and then I got

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
one that I could mess with just for myself.

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,680
And then I could start, you know, breaking things.

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,960
And then when you break stuff, you really understand it.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:57,400
So I wonder, how did this progression go for other people?

51
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,960
Like for you, [name], what was your starting point of?

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:11,520
Yeah, I would say that the starting point was when my father bought a secondhand computer from his work

53
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,400
that his coworker had preloaded with some shareware games or something like that, like DOS games.

54
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,400
It was a Windows 95 computer, but yeah, I would say that trying to even get those to work

55
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:36,080
was an effort in and of itself, like old shareware games. So yeah, that was basically like

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,480
you immediately start to do problem solving because you want to play the games and the

57
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:48,800
games don't work. So yeah, yeah, okay. So basically games seems to be the way that people start

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,480
with computers. Do we need some HPC games that people can play and get familiar with things and

59
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:06,320
so on? Like I would say that why people start, like I tried my, I learned my parents like 486

60
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,040
as well with MS-DOS, but what can I do with that? I can use a matrix printer and write some text,

61
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,360
but if I'm like six years old or something, what does a six-year-old need a matrix printer for?

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:30,160
The games are much more suitable, I would say, because if you only have a productivity computer,

63
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,440
it's not that fun. Eventually, of course, the productivity can get fun as well.

64
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
So, yeah.

65
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
Hopefully.

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Yeah.

67
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
Hmm.

68
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Hmm.

69
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Yeah.

70
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:52,760
Does anyone want to hear what happened yesterday with the stream going down?

71
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,280
And some more stories behind that.

72
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,480
Go right ahead.

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:07,400
Uh, yeah, so in my home a few weeks ago, I got these messages saying electricity meters

74
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,280
will be replaced in your building sometime in the next few weeks, but you'll get a text

75
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,400
message a day or two before that happens, so you have some warning.

76
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,640
So I worried, ah, okay, this is going to be bad, because it's right during the kickstart

77
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,440
course time. But I haven't gotten a message about it yet, so, you know, I've just ignored it.

78
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,560
But, of course, whenever they're replacing the meter of the common

79
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,080
telco equipment in the building, I guess I wouldn't get notified. So my hypothesis is that

80
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,320
yesterday they did that. So I lost my connection for 15 minutes or so. Incidentally, like they

81
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,440
said yesterday, it was right at the same time before the same talk that was interrupted by

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:04,560
the Fastly CDN breaking several years ago. So then I... So at first I was hoping it would

83
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,840
come back soon. It happened towards the beginning of this long break. But then

84
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:20,520
When it was getting closer and closer to time, I switched my laptop tether to my mobile device,

85
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,500
which incidentally my mobile operator had some problems with their network, their mobile

86
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,520
network earlier in the day.

87
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,400
And luckily they weren't right at the same time because then I would have had zero connection

88
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,460
to the outside world at all.

89
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,400
That would be pretty funny.

90
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,900
And all of the fancy production tricks that you might see during the streams, [name]

91
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,460
is basically the person behind all of these.

92
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:55,620
So we would have been in a creek without a paddle if [name]'s internet didn't come

93
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
back.

94
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Yeah.

95
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,860
And then you saw me dynamically adjusting stuff trying to recover.

96
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,340
So that was kind of fun.

97
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,180
But it did show me that it actually wasn't that hard.

98
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,980
My laptop could handle it with the outside screen, and if I just had a little bit more

99
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:25,460
preparation then it would have been much easier.

100
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,940
The hardest part is that I couldn't copy stuff by SSH from my desktop to my laptop

101
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,540
because there was no network and I didn't really know what to do about that problem.

102
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:49,100
Anyway, so it's almost time. Let's review what we've got here for our

103
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,940
answers. So most people haven't used clusters that much.

104
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Please do go and open up the notes and answer these, so this is really important for us to see the interaction and know how many people are around.

105
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:19,020
Yeah, and also usually we have so many people watching this, or hopefully we have a lot

106
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,260
of people watching this.

107
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,180
But when we have a lot of people watching, if you encounter something during the talks

108
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:34,380
that was rushed too fast or something like that, that's something that was unclear for

109
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
you.

110
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:42,260
notes is the best way to make us notice that, and then we can elaborate on the answers that

111
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
we're giving.

112
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,100
So because today, [name] will talk a bit more about what we're going to be going through

113
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,100
today, but there's going to be this kind of like, we're building on a foundation type

114
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,340
of a thing where we build upon the previous things.

115
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:05,740
If something gets lost in translation or something, then it's basically like the foundation

116
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:17,180
is cracked. It's good to fix immediately so that we know how to build upon the information that we

117
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,100
have given. Use the notes a lot. Let us know about any questions that you have. Ask a lot

118
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,860
of questions that there's other people answering as well, because it really, really helps us and

119
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:38,000
it helps you. Yeah. Okay, so let's get started. I will switch to my screen here, I hope. Yes.
