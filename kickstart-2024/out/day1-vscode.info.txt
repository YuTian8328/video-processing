1.9 VScode on HPC - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

VS Code can be used as an interface to a cluster via the Remote-SSH extension.  How does this work?  It has some advantages and can be a good interface, but it comes with some extra things you need to be careful about when connecting this way.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
