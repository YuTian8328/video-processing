00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Hello, welcome back. Hopefully you had a good little break. So next up we have something

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,880
which we call the humans of scientific computing. So it's interviews where we basically talk

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,000
about ourselves. And our special guest this time here is [name], who was in the

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,240
previous talk, actually. Hi. So, [name], can you tell us a little bit about

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,240
yourself again and maybe go more into what's your background and how did you start your career?

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:48,240
Okay, yes. So, I did my bachelor in Germany in Geoecology or Natural Sciences and then went on to

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:58,280
to start my Master's in Geoinformatics from where I went on an exchange year to Finland

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:07,560
to Aalto University during my Master in Geoinformatics and that led me to being in

9
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,860
contact with the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute where I asked for a possibility

10
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,740
to do my master thesis here because I really liked Finland and I really wanted to stay here.

11
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:28,100
This was almost nine years ago now, I'm still in Finland, so it all worked out. I got to do

12
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,020
my master thesis, they actually paid me for it and even offered me a job after that at the

13
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,060
Research Institute where I was working with satellite remote sensing mainly and at some point

14
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,100
they said okay we would actually like everyone to have a PhD because that just makes life at

15
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,980
the Research Institute much easier. Don't you want to start one? And I hadn't thought about this

16
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:59,780
before so much but I was like hey it's the same as my normal work so why not like package it and

17
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,220
do a PhD. As you maybe mentioned before I'm still working on that even though this is now also

18
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:14,100
already almost seven years ago. That's mainly due to it being very short only full-time,

19
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,020
but mainly being part-time. So I did other work during the same time. For a short while,

20
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:25,300
I did it full-time because I got a grant from Aalto University to focus on it, but there was

21
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,900
a few projects that didn't go as planned. Maybe you know about these things. And yeah, nowadays,

22
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:41,620
like two years ago I got an email that CSC was looking for a geoinformatics specialist and I was

23
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:51,060
reading like through the job ad and was like yes yes yes yes oh this sounds interesting but I was

24
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,940
a little bit like afraid also of it because CSC like the big scientific computing center and

25
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,260
my background is not in like really computing or something. I learned most of it actually during

26
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:12,660
the PhD times like I learned about how to use Linux, I learned programming in Python and so on

27
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,820
during that time and I learned also how to use or well yeah how to use supercomputer partly

28
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:32,500
through this course, but also through CSC courses. I knew how to apply this for my research. I knew

29
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,740
how to run something in parallel on the supercomputer, but I had never looked behind that.

30
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:47,300
So I was a little bit like, is this really something for me? But then I talked to a lot

31
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,260
of people in especially the coderefinery community and they very much encouraged me to do that

32
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,980
still and yeah here I am nowadays. I work two years now as a geoinformatics specialist

33
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:07,140
helping geoinformatics researchers with bringing their computations

34
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:16,260
to the supercomputer and doing training and so on and nowadays a bit more general so it's not

35
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,820
any more geoinformatics specific, but also for other fields and to outreach, trying to reach

36
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:30,740
people in the early stages, for example, of their PhD to know that there is these CSC services and

37
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,900
stuff like Code Refinery available. So what does it mean trying to help people to bring their work

38
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:44,420
to the CSC supercomputers? Let's exclude the Code Refinery work and other teaching things.

39
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,060
What's a day in your life look like?

40
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:57,780
Well, so in that regard, it's basically like this morning we had a workshop with,

41
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:05,540
in this case, humanists. So we asked them, do you know about CSC resources,

42
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,820
do you know about supercomputers, that they exist for your work? And they said no.

43
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:19,860
So we had to say like, okay, this is not just for supercomputation, but it's also like if you have

44
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:27,060
something, a small thing that you need to run multiple times, like trying to explain it in a way

45
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,860
that they can relate to it based on their current work. And that is mainly what a lot of this is,

46
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:43,760
trying to lower the barrier towards supercomputing, HPC, all those big words that if you're not

47
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,720
coming from computational backgrounds are maybe not that familiar.

48
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Yeah.

49
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,240
So do you actually help them to like, do you take their code or analysis and actually help

50
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,240
them get it started running?

51
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
Things like that.

52
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Yes.

53
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:12,280
So if we know about that people struggle with making their own code run, for example, on

54
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,480
our supercomputers, then we get to help them.

55
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:27,440
And we get to tell a little bit about the maybe different way of thinking that you need

56
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,860
to start when you switch from your own laptop to the supercomputer.

57
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:41,020
it's very often that we don't know about it. Very many people find that their problem is too small

58
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:48,540
or they are they have not read enough documentation or have some other reason for not asking for help

59
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:55,340
and then of course we cannot help and sometimes we then get to know about it very late in the process

60
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:07,340
And then of course we also still try to help, but the best experience for us and also for the researchers that we support is like when we get involved right in the beginning.

61
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:15,340
For CSC services, for example, when we are already part of choosing the right service because we have so many of them.

62
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:22,340
And as a researcher, it's not necessarily clear what is the right service for me.

63
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,140
service for me. So that is also, for example, a very general question that one can ask from

64
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,180
us where we can say like, okay, this is perfect for this service or perfect for another service.

65
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,700
Yeah. Okay. What have you learned in your past research, like from your research career

66
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:50,920
to what you do now? What did you learn when studying research that helps you now?

67
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,380
I think the main thing that helps me in my job right now that I have learned from the

68
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:07,820
time as a researcher is how, I don't know how to put it, but how a researcher thinks.

69
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,260
It's not just telling, okay, we have these awesome services, here are 20 courses you

70
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,740
can do to learn about these services.

71
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:25,620
But it's more like also thinking about where the researchers are and what are their goals.

72
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,140
For most researchers, that is to get the paper out.

73
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,780
So, that is the main focus.

74
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:38,500
All this stuff like version control, reproducible research is like a minor thing at the side

75
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,860
which might even be bugging them rather than helping.

76
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
Yeah.

77
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
And I think...

78
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
It's like this researcher mindset.

79
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,860
Yeah, exactly.

80
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:52,820
Like being able to help on a level that is actually helpful for a researcher.

81
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,140
Not only like, okay, here is all the things you need to know, but also trying to convey

82
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,860
that there is something as good enough.

83
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,360
There is like small steps you can take to make your and other's life better.

84
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,260
You don't have to do everything.

85
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,860
And that we can actually help with that.

86
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,860
Yeah.

87
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Okay.

88
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:23,100
Okay, so you said you were a little bit worried about the transition when you started.

89
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:30,100
I mean, were you, like, how worried were you and, like, what were the kinds of things you

90
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
worried about?

91
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Let's put it that way.

92
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,140
And then how did it turn out in the end?

93
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,700
Was it actually anything worth worrying about?

94
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,500
No, it was not.

95
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,980
That was the first thing.

96
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,980
I was very worried about not being able to answer all the questions people might have,

97
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:56,400
because one big part of this job that I applied for was user support and was training.

98
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,660
I was not doing a lot of this at the time, mainly with Code Refinery, actually, and there

99
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,460
it was always a second person there.

100
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,740
When I didn't know something, then the second person could jump in.

101
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:16,300
about this being alone there and being alone with a user, with a researcher who asks me questions

102
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,980
and I might not know the answer that was a very scary thing because for me the support I have

103
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:29,820
gotten from CSC was very personal and very good and like of course like that was my picture of

104
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,580
how it's supposed to be and I'm still thriving for that but since then I've also learned that

105
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,580
like, it's okay to not know everything. We cannot know everything. There's so much to know,

106
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,220
like, not only about our services, but about scientific computing in general.

107
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:54,220
And very often, I still know maybe one little thing more than the researcher who is asking

108
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:00,620
the question. So even just telling, hey, I know that we have a documentation page about this,

109
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,300
or, hey, you could look into this tool, this might do what you want to do. That already helps

110
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,180
sometimes so much that the researcher is happily going away. And it feels like having accomplished

111
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,860
something, even though I actually didn't know the actual answer to the problem. And that was maybe

112
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:26,380
the main worry, like not being good enough with the computational side of things. Like someone who

113
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:33,660
has like programmed their whole life or studied computer science or anything like that.

114
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,300
So what do you say? It's like you bring your researcher mindset to the current things.

115
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,180
When you were a researcher, you solved problems no one knew the answer to and you do the same

116
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,180
now.

117
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:54,500
Yes, yes, I think so. And I have to remind myself once in a while about that, like how

118
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:01,540
it was these, let's say five years ago, when I was the researcher struggling with something and

119
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,140
also feeling all my questions not big enough, like what would I have needed at the time to

120
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,860
kind of brave off, ask my questions from the specialists and also what kind of

121
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,380
of support would I have needed?

122
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,500
Like that in many occasions,

123
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,780
because everyone is short on time,

124
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,740
it is the easy answer to find a link to documentation

125
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,420
and just say, hey, read this.

126
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,700
This is an easy solution to many of troubles

127
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,100
that people have.

128
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,220
But as a researcher,

129
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,260
I have gotten that answer also at some point.

130
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,980
And maybe I've even read the page at the time,

131
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,980
but I was not able to put what is written there

132
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,340
into the context of my work.

133
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,660
So nowadays I try to remember that.

134
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,520
And when someone asks a question,

135
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,020
I like try to first ask, okay,

136
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,360
what is this actually about before answering?

137
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,740
With also some links in a side sentence,

138
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,700
like saying, okay,

139
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,040
you could also take a look here at this tutorial,

140
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,380
but also try to explain how this relates

141
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,020
to the actual question that was asked.

142
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,660
Okay, that's good.

143
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,180
So we've got a question from the note.

144
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,540
So I'm at the beginning of my career as a master's student

145
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,120
and I'm considering academia.

146
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,380
What is the thing that one should know when starting?

147
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,540
I guess you're not the academic career path,

148
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,940
but this is similar to a common question I've asked people.

149
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,780
What do you know now that you wish someone

150
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,460
had told you years ago?

151
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:51,180
so. That this path exists, like that there is a way to not be an academic, not be a researcher,

152
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:58,380
doing your own research, trying to write papers and doing that stuff, but that there is also

153
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,460
stuff like you do at Aalto, the research software engineer, stuff like we do at CSC with the user

154
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:11,660
support and so on. People that are very much connected to the research but don't have to

155
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:17,580
write their own papers but rather support everyone who needs the support doing their

156
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:25,020
research and that can be more efficient, faster or just even like getting started with it.

157
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:32,860
So I wish I had known that earlier. I got to know that actually through Code Refinery because when

158
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:41,020
When I visited the Code Refinery Workshop, I got really excited about this, and asked

159
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:47,580
to get involved in the project and do stuff there, and went then from helper to instructor

160
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,020
to an organizer and community manager.

161
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:58,500
But only through joining that network, I got to know that there is so much more beyond

162
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,660
the traditional academics and research software engineering and so on.

163
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:10,220
Yeah. The next question there asks about what kind of positions are in private companies,

164
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,780
which I guess neither of us are really qualified to answer. Maybe next year I could try to

165
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,260
find someone that works at a private company and invite them.

166
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:25,780
Yeah. And I know that there is also a research position in private companies, for example.

167
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,740
But yeah, that as a short answer.

168
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,340
But I mean, I guess the point of this whole interview is that there are positions which

169
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:42,540
are related to research and quite interesting in their own right, which are not the academic

170
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,420
track, which many people are qualified for and don't know about.

171
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,980
Yeah, and it's so interesting to also, as a researcher, you are in your own little world

172
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,380
with your focus point, especially as PhD,

173
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,380
you have your little slice of the world

174
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,820
that you're working on.

175
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,620
But as what we do, we get in contact

176
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,700
with many different people from many different domains,

177
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,380
backgrounds, levels in their, or stages in their career.

178
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,780
And it's very interesting to be part of kind of all of that,

179
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,140
even when it's just a little bit through one question

180
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,820
that we get in our user support sessions or something.

181
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:30,140
Would you say that you have a wider variety or more interesting problems now or when you

182
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,660
were in the academic track doing your own stuff?

183
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,020
Yes, definitely.

184
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:45,180
Also partly because, well, when I was a full academic, it was just when I started with

185
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,140
programming and scientific computing things in general, so I worked on one big project

186
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,860
for very, very long because I just had to learn at the time also.

187
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,540
So I got very sick of that project, but it's still also with me.

188
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,820
But now it's more varied.

189
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,300
So there's many different questions that people come with.

190
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,660
Some are easy to solve, like within a few minutes.

191
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,100
Some need more hours.

192
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Some maybe need more days.

193
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,900
Yeah. And very much varied. Yeah.

194
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:35,900
So we're coming a little bit close to the end here. There's still almost 10 minutes, but please, so now's the time people start writing all your random questions in the notes, the ones that are most relevant to [name], I will raise up, but other people can also answer there.

195
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:44,900
There is a question I would like to answer actually. Do people in industry use these things you mentioned earlier, like conda containers and HPC?

196
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Conda and containers, yes, definitely, if they know about it, that's not necessarily

197
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,540
a given.

198
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,460
And for us, it's probably harder to reach people in companies.

199
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:04,500
HPC, maybe nowadays a bit more than earlier, because, for example, the Lumi supercomputer

200
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,440
is available for companies as well.

201
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,100
And if you go to the Lumi website, you can find out that there is a few companies using

202
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Lumi.

203
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:25,220
So for those, we also offer kind of a specific training and get, oh, we wish, I don't know

204
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,260
how it really is in industry.

205
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,140
Maybe someone who's working in industry can talk.

206
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,140
Okay.

207
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Yeah.

208
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
Yeah.

209
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:41,060
So what do you say that this course that's here now is also useful for industry track

210
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
people?

211
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
Yes.

212
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,100
I would say so, because you might be the one bringing that stuff to the company.

213
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,900
They might not know about it for whatever reason, and you might be the one that then has a solution

214
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,820
to a problem by, for example, knowing how to, well, organize your project to start with,

215
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,620
or if you visit a code refinery course, like knowing how to use Git that can make

216
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:12,260
many processes more efficient, and then the company will be very happy about that.

217
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:26,420
Yeah, yeah. So would you say that these kind of courses give you an advantage when looking for

218
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:34,580
other jobs? I mean, I guess, well, that's probably obvious. Let's say you finish a PhD and you have

219
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,500
a bunch of articles to your name, or you have a bunch of articles and you say,

220
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:46,820
I've trained to use supercomputers in Git. That's pretty obvious.

221
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,420
Yeah, that probably depends on what you're then looking for.

222
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,900
So what I have learned from getting the job at CSC is that just having used a supercomputer is

223
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,660
a very good starting point for even working in supercomputing support, for example.

224
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,860
because you actually know, you might not know every detail, but you can learn that also on the

225
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:19,300
job. I learned so much every day on the job. But you know where the researchers are coming from,

226
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,780
so you have been in the situation that you have asked some of these questions yourself. So

227
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:32,820
I think with that knowledge you can be a very good person to be between the IT admins

228
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:41,780
and the researchers to translate between them, like if the IT admin says like oh this is not

229
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,780
something we do here, then you can start explaining why this is not something we do here for example.

230
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Yeah, cool. So what's your experience with the PhD overall? Would you say it was worth it?

231
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,020
So I'm still working on it, so yes I think it's still worth it.

232
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:10,020
Mainly because I have now also seen in my current job, it's a permanent position, so I would not necessarily need it for that.

233
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:24,020
But we are still working so close with academia that we also want to support research projects from the beginning and support them really a bit more in depth.

234
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,220
depth and for that we need to be part of the research project funding application and for

235
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,540
that it's better to have a PhD to your name because you actually have some academic

236
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,980
merits that help with this with the project application while without that we have only

237
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:48,900
like a few people who can be this PIs of the research project within the company so too many

238
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,540
research projects that want to maybe put us on the application, we have to say no,

239
00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:00,820
because we don't have the people to actually cover that. And I have learned everything that brought

240
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:07,860
me right here, right now, during the time of my PhD. Basically, none of it I learned during my

241
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:15,860
actual studies, master's or bachelor.

242
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:24,860
Yeah. Okay. When do you say like the PhD is basically experience that counts for something?

243
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:30,860
Yes. And I think like, of course, you don't need to do a PhD. You can also work as a researcher after your master's.

244
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:39,500
The PhD maybe allows that you can do or also gives a bit easier the possibility to do courses.

245
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:48,860
Like for example I could get I think over 10 credits for my PhD from visiting CSC courses

246
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:54,140
for example and that also of course motivated me to do the courses because I could fill my credits

247
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:00,300
with that. If I would not have done the PhD I would have maybe done like maybe one course

248
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:04,860
a year or something just to learn something new, stay up to date and stuff.

249
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:11,100
But in that sense it was really useful. Yeah, so we're almost out of time. So

250
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,220
what do you hope to continue learning and what comes next?

251
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:25,260
Well, I hope to continue learning more about how things work, how many of our services work,

252
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:38,820
How to reach, like currently my focus is a lot on outreach so I hope to learn more about

253
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:46,100
how to best reach out to people that would have use for our services and that would have

254
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,620
use for our support because there is so much of it available, so many people that are very

255
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:59,660
happy to help with things and I'm always so sad to hear stories like that someone has

256
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,380
been struggling with something that we could have helped with if we had only known

257
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,940
after two years of struggling or something like this. Yeah. Okay.

258
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,940
Yeah, I guess we're basically out of time. There's a comment that you're really cool

259
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,060
and a good role model. So yes, I would agree with that.

260
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,060
Thank you.

261
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:32,420
You know, many of our visitors here are like that. So yeah, I mean, we have to keep finding

262
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,660
more for next year.

263
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,060
I'm glad to hear this was useful. Thank you for having me.

264
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,380
Yeah, I mean, like really, [name] and all of us, we're basically normal people that

265
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:48,580
want to keep work going, help, basically, yeah.

266
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,620
You're normal nerds.

267
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,120
Yeah.

268
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,340
But yeah, OK.

269
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:57,260
So I guess thank you, [name], and see you

270
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,580
around at the next Code Refinery workshop in September.

271
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,240
Yeah, and if you have any more questions,

272
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,460
I'll still be here and answer them in the document.

273
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,060
Keep them coming.

274
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,860
OK, great.

275
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,580
Thanks.

276
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,060
Bye.

277
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,000
Bye.
