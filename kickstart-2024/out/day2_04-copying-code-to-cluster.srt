1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Yes. So before we start looking at the lessons,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,400
let's check this copy of code to the cluster section.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,880
We will do one thing here.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,080
So the upcoming examples,

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,200
we'll use these HPC examples repository that we have created.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:31,760
So, if you want to follow along with the examples, you should clone this repository as well.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,920
So, we'll talk about when there's time to, like, when do you want to write yourself and

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,520
when do we, when there's type along and when there's not.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,440
But if you want to do the same commands that we do, just be mindful that you need to get

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
this repository.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:56,040
I will do this in my terminal that I have enabled here and now I have the repository.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,800
So I'm now in the folder of the repository.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,760
I just made a quick poll to see how many people have gone through the cluster shell tutorial

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
here.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,760
Yeah.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Yeah.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,160
So, but that's quite simple.

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,880
a few commands to do if you want to follow that. But let's go to start with the interactive jobs.
