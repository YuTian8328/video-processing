1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,680
So, yeah, in the notes now we have this feedback for day 1 and also a box here for what to

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,840
prepare for day 2.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:25,800
So please come and this poll here, comment where things too fast, too slow, write speed,

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
whatever.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:39,040
also have places to note. So what went well, what should we improve for next time, and any other

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,200
comments you have. We always take these into account. So today was like sort of very high

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:57,600
levels. So you saw lots of ideas about things, but not many ways to actually do them. But that's

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,320
the point. So today's sort of getting ready high level stuff, and then it is tomorrow where we

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,000
actually start messing with the cluster and running things. So for that, this connecting

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,800
to the cluster is very important that you have working. By the time tomorrow starts...

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,840
Ah, there goes the cat. By the time tomorrow starts, it will be too late to fix anything.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,600
Luckily, you've got several hours tomorrow morning to work that out.

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
There are some other things to prepare. So, as we see here,

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,960
there's so we'll be using the cluster from the command line and that's not

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,880
something that we will teach but we do have these lessons here which go into

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:02:02,240
the details and yeah so basically if you're not very comfortable with the

17
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,600
command line, read one or both.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,560
Well, they're pretty similar.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,760
Read one of these.

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,720
And actually, maybe try some of the practices and so on.

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,200
And that way, you'll be ready for tomorrow.

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,780
Is there anything else people should do

23
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,280
to get ready for tomorrow?

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,000
Or any other news for the day?

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,080
Yeah, I would maybe just say that today, we

26
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,840
talked a lot about what is involved

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,360
in scientific computing, what sort of things

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
are involved in that.

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,360
And tomorrow, we'll be mainly focusing on how do you actually

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,120
like, we talked a lot about or mentioned

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,200
a lot about resources as asking for resources,

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,360
choosing the hardware you want to run on it,

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,440
that sort of stuff.

34
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,640
And tomorrow, we'll be talking a lot about that,

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,240
like, okay, how do you get stuff in the cluster?

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,120
How do you know where your code is running?

37
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,000
And for that, it's good to,

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,040
like basically the VS code is a good example of something

39
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,920
that you do something on your machine,

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,400
but actually it's been done in some other place.

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,040
Like actually the running has been done in a remote place.

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,320
So tomorrow we'll be basically jumping

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,280
to the never never land of the HPC cluster

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,600
where goals are different and there's different interesting kinds of adventures to be had.

45
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:40,000
So basically, just remember that and be already on the mindset that, okay, we'll be working

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,500
in a different kind of an ecosystem and different kind of a world compared to your laptop or

47
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,160
your computer that you're watching this way.

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah.

49
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,720
I would say like, when I think about my student days

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,080
and the first day of using Triton,

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,960
all of these data would be a bit confusing at first,

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,480
but it's something that you get used to it very fast

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,440
when you get the basic ideas of,

54
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,760
and the basic like fundamental definitions of the job

55
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,680
and the resources.

56
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,880
And so if it's a bit confusing for now,

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
I think it's completely okay.

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,080
and you will get used to it very fast.

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,580
Yeah.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
Yeah, I mean, I think that's sort of the core problem here.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
There's so many layers of things that are built on top of each other.

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,360
There's basic Linux command line usage,

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
and then on top of that, we have remote connection.

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,000
On top of that, we have this whole queuing system.

65
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,520
And then somewhere in there is all the data things.

66
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,480
It is a lot, but hopefully you can get examples

67
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,840
and, well, work through it somehow.

68
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,640
It will take time.

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,880
Yeah, and in most cases, we try to, in many cases,

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,800
it's a bit of a word salad.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,640
So there's technologies, words mentioned.

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:12,400
And if we use unfamiliar words, do mention that in the notes.

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,760
Because this is something that we use the words all the time.

74
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:24,560
We are in the language, we have it, but it's not meant to be like a secret club that you need to

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,880
know the handshakes in order to get into. All of these words are just that we know what the

76
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:43,360
meaning is, but we try to explain them in a way that they're not something that is impenetrable.

77
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,760
So just ask and we'll try to explain them if we forget to mention them.

78
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,920
Yeah. So please continue giving us this feedback here. There's 50 people watching and this is not

79
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:06,800
50 answers. At least this poll would be really nice to see. There is a question,

80
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,080
if you don't have access to a cluster, well, we can only teach it. We can't give you access if

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:21,120
you're not at one of our institutions. But if you're in some university, they probably have

82
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,680
some method of doing this. Or, you know, you can listen, and you have the knowledge, and you can

83
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:41,680
come back later when you need to. Okay. Yeah. Should we end then? I guess we're over time

84
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:54,400
already. So thanks to everyone and see you tomorrow. Please, so as it says here

85
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,800
you can keep joining this zoom for help with connecting and you can keep asking

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,640
us questions here and we'll keep answering for a few more minutes. Yes.

87
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye.
