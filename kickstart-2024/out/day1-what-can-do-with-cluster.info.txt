1.6 What can you do with a computational cluster? - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

A couple of real examples of how people use the cluster 1) Multi-cpu-node computations with LAMMPS, 2) text synthesis with open source Large Language Models (LLMs).  This is a preview of what we will be learning the next two days, but it is *not* supposed to be enough to understand how to do it right now.

01:16 First demo: LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulator using MPI
13:22 Second demo: Visualizing with the Open OnDemand desktop
17:52 Third example: Deep learning with LLM inference

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
