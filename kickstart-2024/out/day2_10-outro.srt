1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,420
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,820
OK, so if you notice there's feedback here,

3
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,740
please fill out the poll.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,180
I see there's a lot more people watching than are answering.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,100
We really need these answers to improve things.

6
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,900
Yeah, do give us as much feedback as you can,

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,340
because we are just wondering here,

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,780
are we doing stuff correctly, or should we

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,700
modify it for the next year, and what should we do?

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,100
So don't leave us hanging.

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,260
Yeah.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,220
So for tomorrow, in case anyone's leaving already, so we'll go over we'll go through the more advanced

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,060
uses, which is mainly many different ways of running things in parallel. And this is really

14
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,060
the real power, like what you've done so far. Well, you could do this on most of this on your

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:03,820
own computer and survive. But tomorrow, yeah, we'll see how we can run tens or hundreds of

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:11,420
things at once with only really small changes from what we're doing now. Make sure you understand

17
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,980
the batch job and monitoring parts of the day because that's what we're using.

18
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,900
So yeah like today we have been like what the name of the job was serial jobs interactive and

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:32,060
serial so they are like very one way but tomorrow we'll talk about like okay what if we add a

20
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:39,180
for loop basically here or like what if we do a lot of stuff at the same time and yeah hopefully

21
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,740
we can get that through in the best possible way yeah

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,700
okay if there's no more questions up here should we start wrapping up

23
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,540
So there is some feedback that it was a bit fast and there wasn't much time for

24
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:11,340
exercises. We know, unfortunately, but luckily you can continue exploring on

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:19,580
your own afterwards. There's no way we could cover it all in a few days or in a

26
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,580
few hours. So our hope it was to give you the inspiration and big picture and then

27
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,620
And you can go and follow up.

28
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,420
So is there any other preparation or things

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
people should do for tomorrow?

30
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,940
Not really.

31
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,460
I don't know.

32
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,140
I guess that's it.

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,640
Yeah.

34
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,140
OK.

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,140
Like, it's pretty much like tomorrow

36
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,220
is pretty much the same, but on a bigger scale.

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,020
But just like whatever we have talked about today,

38
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,580
about Slurm and parameters and whatever,

39
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,220
just keep in mind that, OK, you'll

40
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,820
be needing those tomorrow.

41
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,320
Yeah.

42
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,160
OK.

43
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,260
Yeah.

44
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,820
For this comment here about a demo of these,

45
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,180
I can give some, I'll put some links in here.

46
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,740
But yeah, okay, so see you tomorrow at the usual time.

47
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,380
Yeah, okay, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Bye. Bye.
