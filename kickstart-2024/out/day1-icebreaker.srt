1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello, can everyone hear us?

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,960
Can someone give a reaction, if you can?

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,480
Hello, hello.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:29,600
So if you can, we are here.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,900
What I've shared here is our notes.

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,800
If you've registered, you should have it as a link.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:45,000
We can scroll down to this icebreaker and begin talking a little bit while I try to

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,760
stop my cat from destroying something on my desk.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,920
How come the cat is very active?

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,280
It's just 11.50.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:03,360
I guess it just, well, I don't know, like sometimes it comes earlier in the day.

12
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:11,300
So for anyone new here, my cat often visits during courses, especially later in the day

13
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,040
as it approaches 4 o'clock when it's its feeding time.

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,880
So that's the motivation for staying through the whole time.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,320
So if you leave early, you lose cat observation possibilities.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,760
Anyway, yeah.

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,960
So hi everyone.

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
gotten any indication of audio yet?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,600
I checked the stream and it seemed to

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,080
work at least. Okay, good. But if others want to respond to the

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,640
notes that's of course a good idea. Yeah, so the next question is

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,080
is our audio balanced?

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,120
Should we do the standard test?

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Yep.

25
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Okay.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Me, [name], [name].

27
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
One.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Two.

29
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
Three.

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Four.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Five.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Six.

33
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Okay.

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,560
Let us know who might be quieter.

35
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,640
How can people let us know?

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,480
Well, at least the channel people could.

37
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Yeah.

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,320
So you can write it in the notes here.

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:35,400
Let me open that up. Oh yeah, actually, someone is writing. I'm the loudest. Okay. Yeah,

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,320
I'll turn myself a bit up or just shout a bit louder. Okay.

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,440
So anyway, some people have already figured out how Notes and stuff works. So basically,

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,520
we have this document everyone can write. And as we're talking at any time, you can write questions

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,560
or comments. One of the co-instructors might see it, but we also have a whole bunch

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,040
of people in the background who will be reading and answering during the course. So, you can

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,160
ask as many questions as you want, and usually we get most of them answered.

46
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:22,340
And as a practice, we have icebreakers here. So, please open it up if you're registered.

47
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,380
If not registering, we'll get you the link automatically emailed to you.

48
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:36,440
And then scroll down to these sections.

49
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,900
So what's your position?

50
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,620
Use this O symbol to vote.

51
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,700
So as you see, people are adding different votes here.

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,020
It's like a dynamically generated bar graph that's a poll.

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,060
So yeah, add in your votes there.

54
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:05,660
Then you can also add in where you are now,

55
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,340
so as in what city or country you're in.

56
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,380
Or you can try to be more clever if you want to.

57
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:24,020
What's the biggest computer you've used so far?

58
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,020
Yeah, I mean it could be your own computer or some workstation.

59
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:38,020
And then what do you work on?

60
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:45,020
Yeah, so like what kind of scientific work or other work, basically, while you're here.

61
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,660
So we want to know a little bit about you. And maybe we can start by telling about

62
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:59,580
us some. So I'm [name]. I'm a, well HR considers me a staff scientist at Aalto

63
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:08,660
University. I work in the computing, the high-performance computing team at Aalto. And we also do a

64
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,660
lot of teaching, and then a lot of research software engineer support. So basically going

65
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,540
and helping you with your very code. And I'm really glad to be here. So this is one of our

66
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,780
best and most important courses of the year, and we're glad that we have several hundred

67
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,300
registrations here. [name], do you want to tell a little bit about you?

68
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Yes, so my name is [name]. I'm a Research Software Engineer in Aalto Scientific Computing.

69
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Previously worked on the HPC side of the team as well.

70
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Yeah, I've been teaching this course for many years now in conjunction with other people and yeah, I think it's very good.

71
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,740
we try to make this course as palatable for people that are new to HPC so that they don't get scared

72
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,700
and people can do their research in the best way possible. So I'm very happy to be here and

73
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:23,380
see what we can achieve together during the few days. Yeah okay and [name]. And then it's me

74
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:31,220
which most likely you've seen my name in your mailbox. So I've been coordinating this

75
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,100
adventure as well as many other that we have had and we will have in the future. So in

76
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,740
general we are organizing these type of open courses. I don't know if this is the first time

77
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,900
that you attend a course on Twitch TV. For us it's always exciting even though we've been doing this

78
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,500
for what, two years now? Two years. Or is it three years? Yeah, maybe three years.

79
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,580
Or is it 2021 January? Yeah, anyway. And we hope even actually that this way of

80
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:08,340
teaching is inspiring in a way that maybe next time you want to join us for some broadcasting

81
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,100
together to talk about your research or how you solve some problems that could be helpful

82
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:22,580
for others too. So I would want to quickly mention that we mentioned Twitch. One

83
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,700
quality of life thing for the Twitch stream. I would highly recommend that everybody goes

84
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,620
in the Twitch stream and then checks the gear icon on the bottom right and sets it instead of auto

85
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,620
into the best possible resolution.

86
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Because Twitch tries to modify the bandwidth

87
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,620
or which compression it uses in the stream.

88
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,620
So if you want to see the crisp clear text that we are streaming

89
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,620
then setting it to the best possible resolution is a good idea.

90
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,620
Is this new? So I thought at one point

91
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,300
point Twitch didn't do transcoding for free streams.

92
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,900
I think it does for all streams.

93
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,140
Yeah, it does like less time with performance.

94
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,820
Yeah, exactly.

95
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,980
So from the gear icon on the settings,

96
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,100
you can check the quality.

97
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,420
And if you set it to be the source quality,

98
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,460
you will get the best view of the material.

99
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,300
Yeah.

100
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,660
OK.

101
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,100
So my next question, what's the coolest thing about today

102
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,220
that people should look forward to?

103
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,180
Let's go backwards.

104
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,420
[name].

105
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,340
Well, I'm going to briefly talk about Code Refinery, which

106
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,300
is a six-day workshop, but I will

107
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,900
try to compress it in 20 minutes just

108
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,580
give them motivation for people to take it next time we run it. So at least that's the most exciting

109
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,060
thing that I will talk about today. But what about you [name]?

110
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:17,140
Well I would say the most interesting part for me is like new demos that we have planned for this

111
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:25,380
year. So new demos on how to run few software for softwares in the cluster and hopefully they will

112
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,460
demonstrate what sort of capabilities the computing cluster can have. But also I would

113
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:38,980
say that I always enjoy listening to our guest talk and the guest people who come and discuss

114
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:45,940
about how they how they do their HPC work and how they ended up in the computer like

115
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,220
in the field of doing computations with well scientific computations.

116
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,540
Yeah. Because that's something new every year for me.

117
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:03,220
Yeah. And same for me. I mean, it's easy to get courses and read about technical things,

118
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,780
but the way we've added this interview with how people actually find their careers in these fields,

119
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:17,060
I think, is a story that is really often not told. But with that being said,

120
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,020
it's almost time to get started. Should I switch to my screen for the intro?

121
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,000
Yep. Okay, so we've got 10 minutes. Here we go. This is the
