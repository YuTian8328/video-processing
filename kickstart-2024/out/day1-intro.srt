1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
Yep. Okay, so we've got 10 minutes. Here we go. This is the

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:15,460
main page. You should have this in your info. If we scroll down to the schedule,

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,460
we have the SciComp kickstart intro.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,460
So, really quick.

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,460
Who are we? So, well, we just basically introduced that. We are a team at

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,460
Aalto University, but this course is not just about our cluster. It's about many

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,460
clusters, and we have many partners here who are helping us, although we wish we had more.

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,620
So if you're watching, please be a partner next year.

9
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,540
What's in this course?

10
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,540
So day one is sort of general big picture things.

11
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,580
So about data, reproducibility, computing, and also a little bit of connecting

12
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,980
to prepare for day two.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:06,060
But it's quite generic and stuff that almost anyone could be or should be watching

14
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,580
that's doing anything about computing.

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,060
Day two and three get more specialized.

16
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,700
This is the part where we're actually talking about how to use the cluster.

17
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,220
And, well, not everyone needs to do that yet, but more people do.

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,260
But some people do.

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,140
So who's attending?

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,500
So we have multiple universities, as I said.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,700
Our demos are based on our own university's cluster,

22
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,980
so some of the examples may need adapting to other sites.

23
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:41,780
we will carefully explain what these differences might be and give you time

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,780
to figure it out for yourself. But the big picture, we're trying to make this

25
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,800
useful for everyone. You can ask questions about other universities. They

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,300
might have people watching the notes or they might have their own breakout rooms

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,320
or things like that. You have to talk to your own local people. Practicalities.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,780
How it works. So unlike most courses we can reach hundreds of people. Right now

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:14,740
we have 100 people watching right now. So we are a live stream broadcast. Anyone can watch,

30
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,300
and we have these different pauses, sort of like commercial breaks, for you to work on exercises

31
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,700
or for normal breaks. There is a Zoom for some people, and if you're there, you can work on

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:32,900
exercises when you're there. There's many different parts. So there's talking and demos,

33
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,260
which is on the live stream. There's type along where we're typing and you should also be typing

34
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,780
at the same time. There's exercises where we tell you what to do and then you have time to do it

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,060
yourself. And we have breaks at least 10 minutes every hour, usually towards the top of the hour.

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:59,540
For chat and communication. So we've already gone over the notes here. So the idea is you

37
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,100
you register, you get this link, you can switch to edit mode, and you ask questions in bullet

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,700
points, and you make answers. Or other people make answers. We have a whole bunch of people

39
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:17,900
who are here to do this. So just ask whatever you want, whatever.

40
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,620
So the biggest problem that you might experience is that there's too many questions, and you

41
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,860
can't follow them all. In that case, just don't. I mean, ask your question, come back

42
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,420
later, come read it later, search for what you need, but there's definitely going to

43
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,100
be too many questions asked for you to follow them all.

44
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,220
So don't let that trip you up.

45
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,820
I guess people have figured out the view and edit modes.

46
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,420
So the notes are public, so don't include any names there or other identifying information,

47
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,420
please.

48
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,260
We will remove that right away.

49
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,500
also try to remove it before archival, but better to just do it right now. So can everyone go to

50
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,260
the notes now and try to answer the icebreaker if you haven't done it already? So that is

51
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,980
this here that I was sharing before.

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,740
Okay, so where do you focus? So yeah, there's so much there. So the first priority should be the

53
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:25,580
screen share and what we're talking. If you have time, then your own type along.

54
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,860
Then if you're bored or have a bunch of extra mental capacity, you can start browsing the

55
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,740
notes and seeing what else is there, what other questions. And then the lesson webpage,

56
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,900
if that's relevant to what we're talking about. So we have this really unique vertical screen share.

57
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,620
the idea is to make it big and it takes half your screen and the other half is for you.

58
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,060
After you've experienced this, you'll wonder why other courses don't

59
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:05,740
do this because it just makes so much sense. As [name] had said, you can go to Twitch and

60
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,580
make sure it's on source resolution and not auto to keep it as high as possible.

61
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,500
So we want to be accessible to many learning styles, and not everyone has to take the same

62
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,060
path.

63
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,420
So some people may prefer to watch passively and do the exercises and self-study later.

64
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,500
Some people might be active in all the exercises.

65
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,100
You might leave this on in the background while you do other things.

66
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,200
You might miss a part and want to review videos later in the evening.

67
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,840
answer the Twitch chat question. Yes, this is being recorded. Twitch will have it right away,

68
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,400
and we'll have process videos on YouTube by this evening.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,640
Yeah, so please be nice to all the community and be respectful to each other.

70
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,040
So, teaching is a pretty difficult thing to do, and there's many things going on.

71
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,480
This is a live course, so yeah, things will go wrong. It's okay. Please follow along with us

72
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,520
anyway. Everyone's at different skill levels. That's okay. Please help each other. Everyone

73
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,760
is somehow both a teacher and a learner. We learn from you, and you learn from us.

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,240
If you're in any small groups or whatever, take the time to check in and ask,

75
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,920
how's it going? Does anyone need help? Things like that. We try to do that often with feedback.

76
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,120
And once something isn't right, then speak up very quickly.

77
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,800
Especially if you can't see something you need to see,

78
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,240
or you can't hear something, like our audio is bad.

79
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,360
Just tell us, hey, we're not following, please do something.

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,760
And we'll fix that right away.

81
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,080
Okay, what can and most certainly will go wrong.

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,280
So as I said, you can get overloaded with information.

83
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,720
This is definitely going to happen.

84
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,760
And as we said, take a step back and be more passive.

85
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:09,080
and realize you can come back to it later. The notes, this should say notes and not HackMD,

86
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,720
it's too fast to follow, so then don't follow it. It's published for future reference, so

87
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:22,680
just hide it and remove it as a distraction. If the notes lag and you can't edit, that sometimes

88
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,480
happens, so we try to keep it short but then switch to view mode and wait a little bit for it to

89
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:37,760
calm down some. There's an archive that's posted and a link should be at the top

90
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:45,360
and use that for the stuff that has been removed. If we don't have time to cover

91
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,880
everything, well that's just a fact. We won't. There's far more that we can cover

92
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,960
than we have time to. So we aim to give a big summary and to start you on your

93
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,080
learning path but all the materials there for you to review and come back to

94
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,200
later. We deviate from the schedule. We'll try to stay on track but it's

95
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,400
gonna happen sometimes. We'll adapt to what people are interested in. If there's

96
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,720
major accessibility problems like the audio quality is bad, the screen isn't

97
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,840
visible, you need a break but we're not doing it, our explanation is completely

98
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,400
unintelligible, write the problem right away and say hey I don't understand this

99
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,880
we have this problem. Our instructors will see this and we will do something.

100
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,240
Let's see. If the stream suddenly dies, that means my computer has crashed. In that case,

101
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,960
wait a few minutes and it will come back. If you're missing something important for the course,

102
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,360
well, sorry, that's okay. Wait and come back the next day and work on it. If you can't attend

103
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,760
every day, that's okay. If a cat visits us, well, that's the opposite of a problem, and I'll make

104
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,600
sure to turn on my video so everyone can see it. Expect it later in the day, some. If you want to

105
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,040
know more, ask around. So as final notes, the course is recorded, everything will be put on

106
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,760
YouTube. You cannot possibly be in the video because of the way we're doing it as livestream,

107
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,240
that's the whole point here. But don't add names to notes or anything like that. Anything you

108
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,680
write in the notes will be published with a CC license, so everyone that follows you will be able

109
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:32,440
to follow up on it. Do we assign credits for this course right now? No, we don't. Okay, yeah.

110
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,200
And please join us for future courses or things like that. You can join our chat,

111
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:48,680
join Code Refinery, and take part next time. Okay, that's my part. Is there anything in the notes

112
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:57,920
for the intro now? no, nothing special, but please people feel free to add whatever

113
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,920
questions you might have. okay so that's the intro so who's next for the screen

114
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,000
yeah I could I'm ready sharing if you wanna okay I'll send it to you and [name]
