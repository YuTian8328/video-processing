1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140
it helps you. Yeah. Okay, so let's get started. I will switch to my screen here, I hope. Yes.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,820
So as usual, we have our schedule. It should say everything we're doing.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,740
If we go down to day two, we begin with about clusters and your work.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:23,500
I will also quickly mention that public service announcement, remember to put the stream to

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:32,460
maximum resolution if it's not already there, so that any text will appear as crisp as possible.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,980
But we will mostly talk and look at pretty pictures, but there's text sometimes as well.

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:48,060
Okay, so yesterday we talked a lot about basic concepts of scientific computing, like where

8
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,580
you can store your data, who we are, how to ask for help, things like that.

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,040
Now we get to the real stuff.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,740
The general plan is that today we go into basics.

11
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,100
So what is a cluster, what are resources, how to request them, and so on.

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,660
We get to some of the interesting parallel and GPU stuff tomorrow.

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:16,840
But because a cluster is easy to use if you're familiar with the command line Linux, things

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,560
like that, and hard if not, we're going nice and slow today in order to make sure that

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,760
everyone can keep up and we have this good solid background.

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,880
So yeah, what's a cluster?

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,680
Yeah, so if we think about the cluster, it's basically like a bunch of computers in a trench

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,480
coat.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,760
But it's also a bit more than that.

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:56,080
So a cluster is basically a big system that has many features in it.

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,280
So what we usually have in the cluster is that we first off have a lot of computers

22
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,840
there that are meant for computing. So in this diagram that you can see we have the CPU nodes

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,000
like that is the main thing of the cluster really. We have a lot of hardware there that can be used

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,880
for computing. There's also specialized hardware like the GPU nodes that have GPU cards

25
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:31,720
that are used for GPU computing. And then usually a cluster has a file system as well

26
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,120
So it's own file system, which is connected to these nodes in some fast lane, so that you can

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:47,080
have big data flowing into the CPU nodes and the GPU nodes. And then, yeah.

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,640
So how big is our cluster, just as a reference? So the one at Aalto University.

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:03:04,920
So our is like a medium size, maybe. Medium, small. Medium in Finland, small in international scale.

30
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,200
But we have a lot smaller clusters. Some other universities might have a smaller cluster.

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,320
And for example, the CSC supercomputers, they are a lot bigger. But in our case, it's,

32
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,520
Well, I don't know, actually remember the numbers, like a few hundred nodes?

33
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,640
Yeah, I think it's like the order of 300-ish.

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,080
Yeah, and maybe a few hundred GPUs.

35
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,160
Yeah, a few hundred GPUs, 10,000 processors roughly, last I remembered.

36
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,660
Yeah.

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,480
But you can already hear from what I'm describing here that the cluster,

38
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,400
what is important about the cluster is not necessarily how much there is on the backend

39
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,320
or something, it's how you're going to be using it. And you're going to be using it through this

40
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:04,440
login systems, like login node or the on-demand. And then we will talk about how you get access to

41
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,000
the resources later on. But for me, at least personally, it's more of like, I know that

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,200
there's just resources there, I just need to be able to use them. But it doesn't really matter

43
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,480
where they come from. They are there on the background and there is a way of

44
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,960
getting those resources. And we'll talk about that soon. But basically, there is just a bunch

45
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,640
of computers and those computers are connected to each other with a fast network and there's a

46
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,880
a storage space for your data and then you can use those computers using certain things

47
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,120
that we'll be talking about.

48
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,680
So about our own cluster at Aalto University.

49
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:59,200
It was completely upgraded and reinstalled, well, a month ago.

50
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,880
And everything has changed.

51
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,600
So many of the things you might read might be out of date.

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,320
trying to update them or add warnings there, but just be aware that things are different now.

53
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,000
And we'll talk more about this later. The final thing on this page is asking for help.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,680
So it is really hard to go and do everything alone, especially when you're starting.

55
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,560
So do read about getting help and come to your local support early if you need it.

56
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,440
don't struggle forever. And with that I think we can go on from this page.

57
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes. Okay. So next up in the schedule is Slurm, the queuing system.
