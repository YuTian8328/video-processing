1.4 (Computational) reproducibility and open science - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

Transparency in science is one of the core principles in research integrity.  Did you know that half of published studies are actually not reproducible?  Here we give an overview of CodeRefinery learning materials for those who want to start picking up good enough practices like git version control, clear project folder structure, conda environments, containers.

You can read more about CodeRefinery and its dedicated workshops at https://coderefinery.org/ .

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
