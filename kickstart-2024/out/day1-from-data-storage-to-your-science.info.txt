1.3 From data storage to your science - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

Data is how most computational work starts, whether it is externally collected, simulation code, or generated. And these days, you can work on data even remotely, and these workflows aren't obvious. We discuss how data storage choices lead to computational workflows.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
