2.5 Interactive jobs - HPC/SciComp Kickstart summer 2024

Before we get to scripted jobs (like most people use on the cluster), we will talk about interactive jobs.  This lets us get a little bit familiar with the Slurm system.  You shouldn't use this for running real calculations, but for testing and debugging, it is very useful.

This is part of the Aalto Scientific Computing "Getting started with Scientific Computing and HPC Kickstart" 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.

This course covers the basics of using HPC clusters (and day 1, the general background needed to do good scientific computing work).  It is recommended for all new researchers.
