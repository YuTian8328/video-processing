3.3 Web APIs - Python for Scientific Computing 2022


Often, you need to collect your own data - and often, that data is online somewhere, and you need to write a program to fetch it. This talks about the general idea of a web server and making requests to it and uses the Python "requests" library to demonstrate some sample requests.  We also discuss the big picture, such as when you would want to do this and the security and ethical considerations.

-----

Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a basic to intermediate course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools, such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python and want to know some internals and important libraries for science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.



This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific Computing.
