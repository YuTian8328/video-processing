2.2 Visualizaiton - Python for Scientific Computing 2022


Generating figures is part of the scientific process.  This should not be manual, but ideally they should be automatically generated in final form.  This makes your work reproducible, getting around "oh no I can't make it again" problems.

In this lesson, we discuss the matplotlib Python library which can be used to make figures like this.  This isn't the only Python tool, and may not even be the best one, but it is the base of many other tools and a good point to learn the basic concepts you will apply over and over.

-----

Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a basic to intermediate course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools, such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python and want to know some internals and important libraries for science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.



This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific Computing.
