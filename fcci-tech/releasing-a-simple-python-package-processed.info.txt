Separating Python code and releasing it as a PyPI package

A demonstration of publishing a package on PyPI, by taking some code in a larger library that deserves its own package.  This is designed to be simple and go through the main points, but also is "live" so you'll see where we actually run in to problems (and how we debugged them).  The general contents is below.

Most of what you see here, you can see in pyproject.toml in this repository or the many things online.  This is released mainly because it might be interesting to see the thought process, but you can find the same info in shorter form plenty of other places.

00:00 Introduction
01:34 The rough plan
03:08 Looking at the original code
05:14 What do we need to do?
06:19 Making empty repository (on Github) and cloning it
09:09 Coping the code to the new repo, add README
10:23 Copying the code (think about license and dependencies)
13:56 Conda environment for test installation
15:34 Try importing it with Python
16:19 Realize we need some test data, create proper tests
20:35 Development dependencies
22:14 Creating the pyproject.toml file
28:15 Try to install and realize we need a docstring and version
29:44 Try to install with `pip install .` and it works - discussion
31:54 Trying to upload to PyPI (build, upload)
36:39 .pypirc and debugging the upload... went a bit off track here.
36:53 Skip this part unless you want to see debugging...
42:08 Summary
43:18 Citations with citations.cff
45:35 Demonstration of installing from Github
48:26 More summary
50:39 We are back!  We figured out how to do the upload
50:55 What went wrong?
51:09 Adding the data file for the tests and demonstrate running the tests
52:52 API tokens for PyPI
54:09 Uploading with `flit publish`
56:24 Installing with `pip install`
56:50 Final wrap up, looking at what we got
