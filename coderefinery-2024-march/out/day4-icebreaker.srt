1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
I'm less loud than the other two, but it's always, I don't remember who said that people

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:09,920
always start with, so, so, let's get this started.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
Exactly.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,040
I'm sharing this collaborative notes document

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,800
that most likely you are familiar with.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
And there you will find a couple of icebreakers.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,000
Should I start asking [name] about the first icebreaker?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Works on my computer.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,080
Like, I guess you heard this sentence.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,680
You know, what does it mean in practice that you

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,040
trying to, I guess the context here is that you're not able to get something work on your computer

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,800
and you ask me and I'd say, well, it works on my computer. Has this happened to you or?

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:59,720
Oh yes, it has happened. And we have solved it in many different ways. Sometimes we just say,

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,440
okay, I don't need to run it. You can run it. It works on your computer. Please do the work now.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:14,520
In other cases, restarting, like it says here also, has also helped to solve the magic of

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,440
these computer problems and more recently, like in, let's say, in recent years after

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:30,000
visiting the CodeRefinery workshop many years ago, also stuff like containers have helped

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and I guess we're going to discuss that today.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How about you?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,960
Yeah, no, I was just thinking that in general, this is such a common problem that, you know,

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,500
you might be trying to help your grandparents with their phone and you look at their phone

22
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,360
and it behaves in a different way than, you know, even though you have the same model

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,840
and same everything, it's, it's, it's quite amazing that, you know, that technology in

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:04,760
general tends to not be that, how can I say, reproducible or, you know, stable, robust.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:11,560
But usually, yeah, restarting it or when it comes to software, reinstalling it sometimes

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,960
fixes magically.

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,640
I mean, isn't it actually pretty amazing when something does work across other computers?

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,900
I mean, like, just imagine if I write something and it works on three different operating

29
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,900
systems of computers and three different operating systems of phones, or two phones, and who

30
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900
knows however many other things.

31
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Yeah.

32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,080
That's a big deal.

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,360
It's certainly still a feeling of magic when that actually works, like, first try.

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,160
And you send some code or try to run it on a different computer, and it just works.

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,000
And you're like, wow, I tried it.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,920
So what are the reasons why something usually doesn't work then?

37
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,960
Good question.

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,160
Exactly, there's so many reasons.

39
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,240
Like even this part, this thing of the restarting, you know, I was trying to explain to my child

40
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:23,120
that your phone went to a state that it's not the usual anymore, so you need to restart

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
it too.

42
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
Yeah.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,720
So wait, what's a good metaphor, a non-technological metaphor, where you have to restart it?

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,880
Yeah, that's a very difficult one.

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm thinking of cooking, because cooking is our usual one.

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:48,280
I guess that you know that if you messed it up, yeah, you have to restart in a sense that

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,840
you have to throw away everything and re-remake your, I don't know, or...

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,800
What about one of these forever stews where there's a pod and you keep adding stuff to

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,480
it and taking it away, and it keeps going for, well, days or weeks, but sometime it

50
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,200
gets messed up and it's too spicy or too whatever.

51
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,440
or poisoned or something, and you have to throw it all out and start from the beginning.

52
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Because many other things, I mean, when you're cooking, normal cooking, you restart on every

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,000
new recipe.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,880
Of course you can get the master chef who is able to fix if it's too spicy or too bland.

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,200
But we still have a couple of minutes and the second icebreaker is about what do you

56
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,440
know now about programming and scripting and software, which you wish somebody told you

57
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,040
when you started?

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,840
This is the kind of question that we have always been asking each other and always been

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,680
asking to whoever comes across that.

60
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,200
It's not truly or strictly related to this day, but in general, you know, some kind of

61
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,440
advice for your younger self or future self?

62
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,440
For me, what it says there, how to organize folders and code is definitely one big one,

63
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,080
and how much it matters. Because maybe you have heard about that before and you're like,

64
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,280
ah, yeah, but I'm just trying something out now. I don't have to worry about this. And then

65
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,360
it grows and grows and it's more messy and messy and at some point someone asks you hey can you

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,000
share this and then you have to like either put some order in your mess or write like

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,200
super long documentation where to find the different files and where to find the different

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:55,320
data so how much also this organization actually matters for your future self and how much time it

69
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,120
it can save you would also be my answer here about you.

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,960
Yeah, I mean, I feel in a way related to this kind of about the physical

71
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,360
geography of the systems we use, because I feel that sometimes,

72
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,800
especially the the new generation might be growing with iPads or other devices.

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,520
They don't know the kind of, you know, geography of the file system,

74
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,800
that there are folders, that there are processes.

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,160
And so, and then when people start working with, you know, super computers or HPC clusters,

76
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,600
then suddenly, is it now on my computer, am I, you know, where am I in the network of

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
computers?

78
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,800
So, this actually helped me a lot, understanding where am I, what is connected to the place

79
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,280
where I am now, to kind of, you know, then understand, okay, I can't do this, what I

80
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,840
would normally do in my laptop, because I'm not on my laptop

81
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,340
anymore.

82
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm somewhere else on the internet.
