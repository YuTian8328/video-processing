1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
All right, how has yesterday been for you?

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:20,320
It was a bit chaotic preparing for today.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,000
So our nice sound effects seem to have affected Whisper's transcription of our video via

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Well, I don't know how, which gave me a bit more work releasing the videos yesterday,

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,360
but let's see.

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:43,240
Yeah, the way I feel is so, but is that there is some meme about it, but imagine you drive

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:50,240
a car and you try to change the wheels while the car is driving and you do like repairs

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,000
and the thing is still rolling and you hope that you don't break anything.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,040
And that's how I feel.

10
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,080
So it's really chaotic, but it's a lot of fun.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,880
And I think overall, we make it look like it's under control.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,880
So the car is still driving?

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
Yes.

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Good.

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Yeah.

16
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:20,720
So I guess we'll tell a bit more about this later, but the biggest difference is that

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,600
today, we've tried to add an RStudio track.

18
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,320
So let's see how well it works.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:45,000
It's, well, a little bit, um, it's a little bit off somehow, well, not off, but it might

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
might not be perfect, but it's probably enough to try.

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
By the way, did you see that we got

22
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,640
some more questions yesterday?

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,480
Yeah, let's go over those.

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,700
So people might use of the document

25
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,280
and that's exactly the right thing.

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,480
So we encourage you to also, after the workshop,

27
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,920
come back to the collaborative document, add your questions

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,880
and we will see either right now,

29
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,320
you can see here happening live or in the evening even to still answer your questions.

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:32,120
So, I'm answering the third one. Can someone else look at the first ones?

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,640
Staging, that is maybe a question to [Name]. Are we still looking at that?

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:47,640
No, but, and we, so we have this optional episode staging.

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,040
Yeah, that's linked.

34
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,200
It really makes sense in on the command line.

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,200
It makes also some sense in VS code.

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,120
So some editors, they know about it, it, but the, but the episode, it's not if you do,

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,440
if you work only on GitHub GitLab,

38
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,880
you don't really need it.

39
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,780
So that's why we will not go everybody through it.

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,920
But if you're interested, please have a look.

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,240
We have exercises there.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,720
We have two nice explanations there about what that is.

43
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,200
And I can maybe just very briefly explain

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,080
what the staging area is

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,440
and what it means when we say we stage changes.

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,840
it means that you can prepare a commit even before committing.

47
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,680
So you can stage things nicely. It's like a little staging tray,

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,280
or you can think of it as a shopping cart where you put things into the shopping cart

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
and out of the shopping cart and then you change your mind again, you put it back into the shopping

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,320
cart and before you go into to pay for the groceries and that which would then correspond

51
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,720
to the commit. But we will not all go through that.

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,240
Thank you for the little explanation here. Yeah, the page is also linked here,

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,480
so everyone who's interested in that can go there. And then we have also the question about

54
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
there's some background noise.

55
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,840
It's my office.

56
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:37,200
Someone says that it's really helpful to go through the notes after the sessions and if

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:44,240
they will be available indefinitely and that is so that they will not be here on this document

58
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,560
like you may have noticed that they vanished during the day already into an archive document

59
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,720
and in the end of the day we have always someone going through the questions making sure that

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,320
everything is answered and then we will link them from our workshop page which are also linked here

61
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,800
so you can always go back to the workshop page and then go through every day and see

62
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:11,000
the questions and answers that were on these different days so yes they are available

63
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,520
and then this last question was a little bit more

64
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,200
There are more details and I think [Name] is still answering here.

65
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Yeah.

66
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:31,720
But I really like this question because it shows cases where, like, the workflow doesn't

67
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,760
fit in this perfect standard Git kind of flow.

68
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,680
Or if it did, it might be too much work to actually arrange it that way and in the end

69
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,680
not really worth it.

70
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Um,

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
yeah,

72
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,680
so, yeah, so in this

73
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
question, someone has, so we

74
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,680
usually say that the

75
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,680
original files should be

76
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
tracked with version control,

77
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
and then, um,

78
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
and then, the

79
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
like, generated files, like

80
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
the compiled code, or the

81
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,960
document PDFs, things like that, would not be tracked. So it's what we call

82
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,520
ignored. And there's a gitignore file that helps git to ignore these. But here

83
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,000
this is a case where you have the original files and they get generated

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,680
to something else and then slightly modified, but you'd also like to keep

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,960
these other modifications available at the same time. And you could work really

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:43,200
hard and construct some big thing to keep them in sync. But in practice, if it's not

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:53,120
a huge project, it may not be worth it. So, yeah. So, you know, generating it manually

88
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,480
editing and keeping it in sync manually might be okay.

89
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,300
If you did use branches, I guess you could have the same repository checked out in two

90
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,100
different branches in different places. And if the generation is the same, version control

91
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:17,260
might even help you to update the generated files while preserving your manually generated

92
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:27,900
things by merging the new changes in with the manually edited ones. But yeah, I mean,

93
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,540
it's something to figure out basically.

94
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:38,540
Okay, it's 10 o'clock here in Finland, so I think it's time for the jingle.

95
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Yeah, okay.

96
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,540
Should we just do a short one, and then do we go to [Name]'s screen for another introduction?

97
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Yes, for a short one.

98
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's see if this works.
