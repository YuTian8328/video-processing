1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,540
Let's see if this works.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:11,540
Okay, we are back.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:18,540
Okay. Hello, and welcome to day two of the Code Refinery workshop.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:28,540
So we had an intense day yesterday, learning about the introduction to version control.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,540
And I see there might be an issue with the audio.

6
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,340
Is there? Should I wait to continue?

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,540
I don't think so.

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,580
I'll continue.

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,060
Go ahead.

10
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,020
And you let me know if...

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,500
Keep going.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,420
Okay, seems okay.

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,220
All right, so a short recap of the day one of the introduction to version control.

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:03,700
So we learned about a few things yesterday and I intentionally use here the Git terminology to

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,580
make you aware that these are the things that we learned about yesterday and maybe you can

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,620
understand this now and if not then don't worry you can always go back and review them.

17
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:20,740
And we will also make use of them today and tomorrow so that they will get more into the

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,520
routine of your words you should usage.

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
So first we had a motivation for

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,120
version control and what it is.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,600
Cloning and forking repositories,

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,480
committing changes and pull requests.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,920
And for today we will move from what we

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,500
did yesterday in the web interface

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,260
to more local work so to follow

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,200
along for today you will need either

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,700
VS code installation or a command

28
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,080
line terminal setup and you can

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,480
find instructions for that in this.

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,600
behind this link, but many of the parts can also be done through the GitHub web interface.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,600
And even if you don't have anything set up, it's still fine to watch.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,400
Please don't run away.

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,400
There's a lot of things that you can learn also by just watching other people do stuff

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,040
here.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:15,000
And then we had a lot of comments yesterday in the feedback, for example, also that we

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,160
some R users that would like to see how Git can be used from, for example, RStudio. So we tried to

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,440
add at least a basic getting started version for RStudio for today already. So you can take a look

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:38,920
and see if that helps you and you can follow along the exercises. For anyone who joins today for the

39
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,520
first time, how this workshop works briefly. So this is a live streamed workshop. Everyone will

40
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,880
watch the live stream of the instructors talking and showing demos on Twitch. This week there will

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,080
also be exercises which you can do either by yourself or in a team that you might be in a

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:05,320
room with or in a Zoom call. And in week two there are no dedicated exercise times but you can always

43
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,760
interact with the instructors via the collaborative document which I will show in a moment.

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,760
And then we plan on having a minimum of 10-minute break every hour.

45
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,760
If we should forget, please let us know in the collaborative document.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,760
So even though this is a live stream workshop, you are never alone.

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,760
And you are always in contact with the team behind the scenes and also the instructors.

48
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,760
This collaborative document now shows you now briefly how that works.

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,760
So we use it to distribute information to you.

50
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,560
information to you, we tell you about links, we tell you about the agenda, and then this

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,040
is also used for questions. You have gotten the link to this document in the registration

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,560
confirmation email or an email after that. So if you haven't registered to this workshop,

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,760
please do so on the Code Refinery web page. So this is how the document looks. We have

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,740
a few informations here, some questions already, and then some icebreakers. So let's go and

55
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:16,380
answer that. To edit the document you find this little pen symbol which might be up here or up in

56
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:25,100
the right depending on how you're viewing it. You click that one, you scroll down to the icebreaker

57
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:32,300
question and there we have one first one. What's your spirit animal? Today I feel like a penguin

58
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,780
so I'm going to put penguin here and I'll leave some space for everyone else to add their

59
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,260
spirit animal here as well.

60
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,060
Then we have a second icebreaker question,

61
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,400
which types of project can you use Git,

62
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,040
and which will you use it for in the future?

63
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,100
Now we have learned already something about Git,

64
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:01,380
so maybe you've got some ideas of what this can be useful for,

65
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,100
and maybe I can put here all our code refinery work is on Git,

66
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,020
or most of ours, we write like the materials, presentations, the web page, everything is on Git,

67
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:23,500
so that's a good use for it also apart from code. Put it like this. And then you can see here

68
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,980
already some people have already added questions. This is where you can always ask questions.

69
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:34,620
Please like. No question is too stupid. No question is too basic or anything. We have a whole team

70
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:42,380
here behind the scenes that will answer those for you and because it will be shown on stream

71
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,180
once in a while please don't put any names or other identifying information in that document.

72
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,260
You can find all the materials linked from the workshop page so if you know where you registered

73
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,260
you can scroll down here to the schedule where there is day two introduction to

74
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,380
version control this is where you can find the materials for today.

75
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,540
And they will also be available after the workshop and

76
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,140
well I can't say forever but for a long time.

77
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:21,020
So don't worry. Then you can also find the unedited recordings of for example

78
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,260
yesterday on Twitch still for a week I think.

79
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,500
And then with about one day delay we also have the edited

80
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,900
recordings with subtitles and so on on the Code Refinery YouTube channel.

81
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:44,620
If you want some certificates, a certificate for this course, we are currently updating the

82
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,980
instructions for that, so please stay tuned. It's also on the workshop web page. There is this link

83
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:57,260
up here, certificates, where you'll find instructions on what you need to do to get one.

84
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:05,260
And then I would like to highlight just one more thing that we have on March 26th and April 2nd.

85
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:17,260
These Bring Your Own Code sessions. This is a time where many of the instructors of this workshop and also people behind the scenes will hang around in Zoom for about two hours.

86
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:29,260
And everyone who joined this workshop or also previous workshops can join, bring your own code and get help from experts and specialists in implementing these concept learns in this workshop.

87
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:45,260
So if you have a question like this more detailed question that we had here on the collaborative document before, and you would like to just have a quick chat about it with one of the instructors, for example, then these sessions are a very good time to join us.

88
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,900
And that was the short, quick introduction.

89
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,220
So now I will give over to [Name] and [Name].

90
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:57,220
who will lead you through today's materials.

91
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,240
Thank you.

92
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,220
Thanks so much, [Name].

93
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,060
Thanks for the intro.

94
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,260
Thanks [Name].

95
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,000
Thanks everybody helping also in the document.
