6.3 Modular Code Development - CodeRefinery 2024 Mar

In this live-coding demo session we take a Python script as starting point which reads data, computes simple statistics, and generates a plot. Together we then improve this code based on suggestions from the audience to arrive at a more reusable code with reusable components. We start in the Jupyter notebook, later move to a Python script/module, introduce testing, and finally introduce and motivate a command line interface to our code.

In this demonstration we use JupyterLab, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, pytest, and Click.  It is also a great demonstration of pair programming.

This is part of the CodeRefinery March 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.  In this workshop, week 1 was redesigned and day 1 starts with concepts in the GitHub web interface, and days 2-3 move to local work.
