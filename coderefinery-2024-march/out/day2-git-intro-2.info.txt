2.2 Git Intro day 2 - CodeRefinery 2024 Mar

Part 2 of the previous video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sddxBsL799M&list=PLpLblYHCzJADIsbUhXSrC0qW5wDsH-F9U&index=3

We continue where we left off from day 1.  We advance by working locally: first, cloning a repository and doing some of the same things we did yesterday (committing, branching, etc).  Then, we clone a sample repository and use it to practice more advanced history inspection.  Then, we show and practice taking a project that isn't controlled by git, doing the "git init", and doing all of the tracking, linking to the web repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc).  The day ends with lots of practical advice on various topics.
