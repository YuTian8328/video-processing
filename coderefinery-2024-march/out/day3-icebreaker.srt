1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,800
Here we go, icebreakers. So, did everyone have a good night?

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:16,320
Or I guess the real question, did [Name] have a good night doing all the revisions

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,840
that we're going to benefit from today?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,040
I feel good about it, yeah. So there were some late night changes, but

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,080
But when we really start, I will invite everybody

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,120
then to reload the browser tabs.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,520
But I'm really happy about the changes.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,920
I think we have a good plan for today.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
We should do the audio check.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,320
I forgot.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,440
So remember how this goes.

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,680
So me, [name], [name], [name]

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,240
is the order on my screen.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,680
One.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,240
One.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,880
One.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,000
One.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,320
Two.

19
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Two.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,860
Two.

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,360
Two.

22
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,360
Three.

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,660
Three.

24
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,760
Three.

25
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,160
Three.

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,660
So...

27
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,960
Okay, I'm a bit lower than others.

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,060
I think that means...

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,560
I need to make others a bit lower.

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,260
Krager has sounded a bit grainy again to me.

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:33,880
Okay, I reduced the volume slightly, the input volume.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
Now it sounds good to me.

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
Should we test again?

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
One.

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
One.

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
One.

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
One.

38
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Two.

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Yeah, it sounds better.

40
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Yeah, so it sounded a bit better.

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,160
I feel like for the future we need a different audio test.

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:04,760
They are so sharp, like one, two, we need words.

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,920
Maybe everyone needs to sing, like high and low, so that we get the full spectrum.

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,120
Yeah, like a canon would be really fun.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,200
We sing to Jingle in the future.

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:35,400
Okay, so. Yeah, today we've got all kinds of cool stuff here. So, today's lessons have

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:44,360
been updated similar to days 1 and 2. It's still basically the same concept as before.

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,300
So we really practice contributing to other projects on a big scale.

49
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,280
So days one and two were all about sort of working on your own projects where you can

50
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,800
really push directly and sort of, um, like you push directly, you don't have to worry

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,360
about pull requests and things like that.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,560
But today we go to the pull request and we'll actually work on some projects where everyone

53
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:22,800
in the course will contribute. And these will be really cool. But you will see how that

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,920
goes in a bit. So of these icebreaking questions, what did you have for breakfast? Or not that,

55
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,680
what's the biggest, most collaborative projects you've been on?

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,320
Yeah, that's the more interesting one.

57
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,320
For me, it's actually Code Refinery.

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,120
It is the contributing to materials and all the different repositories that we have to

59
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,000
work on different stuff.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,720
Otherwise, I've only been working on my own mainly or with one more person.

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,280
How about you?

62
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,440
So I was also thinking Code Refinery for one of the biggest things.

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:12,080
Like I've done isolated pull requests to some bigger projects on GitHub, but it's more like

64
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,480
a drive-by contribution than long-term collaboration kind of stuff. So I think Code

65
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:29,040
Refinery still is it. [name], what about you? I'm not sure how many collaborators Code Refinery has,

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,720
but I would mention PlasmaPy, which I just checked has 125 collaborators.

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,680
I implemented some features for that library. So I would say that's the one.

68
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,320
Did this use the pull request kind of workflow or how did you contribute there?

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,800
Yes, it does. And it's actually very formalized. So I learned a lot there.

70
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,800
Okay. It's like they have all these rules and templates and this is how you should do it.

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
and what you need before you submit it and so on.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,480
Yeah, these are very helpful.

73
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
Yeah.

74
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,660
And [Name], what's your biggest projects?

75
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,360
Maybe it's now Codefinery.

76
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,360
So I was collaborating to some projects

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,360
with over a longer time with maybe 20 active developers.

78
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,440
It wasn't very formalized.

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,440
So no issue templates or pull request templates,

80
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,720
but using issues and pull requests or merge requests.

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,320
So these projects are actually on GitLab,

82
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,520
but it's really the same workflow.

83
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,080
And then I like your term drive-by contribution.

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,560
So I have a couple of drive-bys

85
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,520
where I appeared, I did a little thing,

86
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,720
and then, but these are projects that I'm using

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,040
and where I sent in a small change.

88
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:08,640
And then lots of own projects, and some of them get the occasional drive-by pull request

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,040
from somebody else.

90
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:20,440
And will you talk later about how the pull request kind of workflow has made these large

91
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,360
projects possible?

92
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Well I think we will get there.

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,600
We'll nicely build it up from a smaller group.

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
So today, we'll start with a setup

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,760
that can work well if you are two people or more.

96
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,400
And we will work towards a scenario

97
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,820
where you will be able to suggest changes

98
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,760
to basically any project.

99
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,720
We will not go into the very formal template

100
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,560
because that depends on the project and then

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,740
one or some really the big projects,

102
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,060
they have contribution guidelines that one should read.

103
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,720
So we will not go through into that,

104
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,960
but at least we will learn all the techniques.

105
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,800
We will also discuss them later today

106
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,640
on even how to approach a project of somebody else.

107
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,400
Like if you have an idea or you have a question

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,440
or you have a suggestion,

109
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,160
like how to do that in a good way.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Should we start, then?

111
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
So, do we go to who's screen?

112
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
My screen. Okay. Are you sharing now?

113
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Yes, I'm sharing.
