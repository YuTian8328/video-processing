1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,740
So, as usual, we have some icebreakers here, some interesting questions to think about.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:16,420
And today we've got, how would you explain your current job to someone from the year

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:24,180
1700, which is something I saw on some sort of social media in the last few days.

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,100
So I guess if many of us do computer things, this will be hard, but let's see how well

5
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,180
we can abstract ourselves back down.

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,420
is what's the best documented project you've seen? And do you prefer reading short social

7
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,300
media posts or long blog posts? So, of the people here, how would you explain what you

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,180
do to someone from...

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,740
I mean, I like the first one, actually.

10
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,700
Yeah. I mean, that's what I wrote, so...

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,700
Oh, okay.

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Yeah.

13
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,700
Some would guess that that was one of us in some way.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Yeah.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:12,700
I mean, it's at least clear it's a research software engineer or, yeah, a support person.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
I mean, I guess that is sort of general.

17
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,700
Like, there's complicated machines or other tools.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,700
People need to use them, but aren't the specialist in there.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,700
And people exist to help with that.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:32,900
I think one of the problems that I see was explaining it to someone from the 1700s.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:40,580
I see my work at least very much as helping people to allow them to keep their specialization

22
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:48,380
and not, well, having to worry about anything else or having to worry about nitty-gritty

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
things.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,700
While in the 1700s I think there was not that much really specialization in science at least.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,260
I mean not necessarily in science, but in 1700s we are already in the industrial revolution, right?

26
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,260
Yeah, I mean very, very, very beginning.

27
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:16,020
Yeah, I mean the first industrial revolution is sort of going on or done, the second hasn't started.

28
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:29,020
So you have people whose job it is to operate a big machine like a windmill or a certain part of a boat, I think.

29
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
Yeah.

30
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
At least mills.

31
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,020
It's like applied research and science and so on.

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Or, you know, something like that.

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,820
What do you think the, well, the second job, reading letters and writing letters,

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:54,340
is that a scientist making journal articles? Maybe? Maybe.

35
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,420
That's what a scholar does. Yeah. Organizing assemblies of

36
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,300
people to discuss that conference organizer or something.

37
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:18,700
email and chat. So, okay, so it could be any job, but you're so busy writing emails that

38
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:25,780
you can't do your main job, which is a lot of manager, I guess. I guess that's also partly

39
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,500
me. Mathematically rephrasing what people have already invented in 1700. What is that

40
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:43,380
job. Could it be some sort of programmer or other researcher that's using math that's

41
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:50,420
already been known then but doing it faster in computers now?

42
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:58,220
A lot of math, actual math research is rephrasing, I can't speak right now, rephrasing stuff

43
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,140
that people have already invented, but making it easier to use and clearer.

44
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:09,700
And, well, even making it usable, because there was just not the computational power

45
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:16,860
before now. There's quite a lot of stuff that, well, in theory would work, it just

46
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:25,900
took too long, and now computers are fast enough to, yep, now you can actually do this.

47
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,200
So if you're just joining now, we have an interesting icebreaker there.

48
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,400
If you registered, you should have the notes link, and well, you can read the questions

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,440
as well as I can read them, so let's play this game.

50
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,880
But so today, well, [name] will have some interlater.

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,720
How do you think the workshop's going overall, everyone here?

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,600
Have you all been happy?

53
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,920
I think it has been going well, like the week one redesign was very successful, like looking

54
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:11,800
at the questions that we got, more into towards how researchers actually encounter version

55
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,520
control and GitHub on their journey.

56
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,880
And week two, I'm still a bit unsure about the no exercise sessions

57
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,960
because they have always been very nice.

58
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,740
And I've gotten people into looking at these things themselves

59
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,080
and trying to figure them out versus us showing it on stream.

60
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,120
It probably depends a lot on how people learn best.

61
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
Yeah.

62
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,920
What is more beneficial?

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
Very true.

64
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,760
What do you think?

65
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:56,400
This is definitely helping us cover more ground and not feel as busy and not feel like we're

66
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,080
always running out of time.

67
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,280
I do hope that this also moves more to the direction where we can then support people

68
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,640
after the workshop and make this more of a mentor thing.

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:19,640
I suppose that means people joining our Zulip chat and asking questions there when they have questions.

70
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Because, of course, during the workshop, we have the collaborative document, the notes, which we will not be actively checking after the workshop.

71
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Yeah.

72
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,680
I mean, yeah, my ideal would be for the second week, imagine if we could do the workshop like

73
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,480
we've been doing now, but then in the afternoons we could arrange some sort of like, well, like

74
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,920
the bring your own code sessions, which we actually have for Code Refinery, but we should be doing as

75
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:02,040
part of our own individual or institutions also. We could tell people, okay, next week come to

76
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,040
our garage with any of the questions from Code Refinery about how to do it and we'll help you

77
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:14,840
set it up and or you know help you do the exercises test it out whatever it may be

78
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:25,800
and that would be good but it's almost time to get going um if you're joining now please write your

79
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,800
job. So you can see the icebreakers here. How would you explain your job to someone from year 1700?

80
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,680
And if you can't figure it out, write down what you do and we'll work together.

81
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,840
So I propose some sort of workshop for other teachers or people that run workshops

82
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,800
that will discuss how we do this very kind of streaming workshop. So basically, I would help

83
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,040
train people, train other people to do it. If this is interesting to you, look at the most recent

84
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:16,520
Code Refinery blog post and see what it says. We can announce that at the end. I guess it is time.

85
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,120
So, [name], I think you have an intro for us. Yes. Do you want to play the jingle, the short

86
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:39,120
one. So, welcome! [name], I believe you have our first intro. Yes, are you sharing

87
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:47,720
my screen to the stream? There you go. Okay, very welcome to day five of this Code Refinery

88
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,840
workshop. We're almost at the end already. Very sad about that. Soon it's over. But we still have

89
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,600
two days ahead of us. So week one of this workshop was all about version control from really the

90
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:12,920
basics of Git to collaborative use using GitHub. And then yesterday we started week two with an

91
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:20,360
overview around the reproducible research. We discussed how to record computational steps with

92
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,400
SnakeMake as an example tool, dependencies with Konda as an example tool and environments

93
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,520
with containers. And in the afternoon we then took a peek into the FAIR research software

94
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,960
development practices, licenses and what you need to know about these kind of things.

95
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,200
related to your research code. So today we're going to look into different ways of documenting

96
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,840
your research software, meaning from comments to readme files that we now have been looking

97
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,680
a little bit at already, and then to actually doing really nicely rendered web pages similar to

98
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:13,560
the Code Refinery materials pages and how you can do that like with a few small commands yourself.

99
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,560
And then in the afternoon we will take a look into the world of Jupyter notebooks and that you maybe

100
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:28,520
have already come in contact with during computing classes or while like working by yourself.

101
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:36,520
And here we're going to focus on things that can make your research also more reproducible

102
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,840
using Jupyter, for example.

103
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,840
So even if you know it already, I think there will still be something new in that lesson

104
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,240
as well.

105
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,840
And then for newcomers today, this workshop is fully live streamed.

106
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,880
So you will all watch the sessions via Twitch.

107
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,840
And if you know the workshop from before this year,

108
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:09,200
we don't have any dedicated team exercises in this second week.

109
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,680
But we have a lot of time for interaction

110
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,680
with our collaborative document, which

111
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,680
I will be showing in a moment.

112
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,000
And then we plan to have a minimum of 10 minute

113
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,640
breaks every hour plus a one-hour break over, well, in Finland,

114
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,160
midday lunchtime.

115
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,280
So our collaborative document, you should have,

116
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,200
or you have gotten the link after you

117
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,760
registered to this workshop.

118
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,040
It looks something like this.

119
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,680
And depending on how wide and how zoomed in you have this,

120
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,760
you will find a little pen symbol up top.

121
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,880
me it's now up here to the right for you it might be somewhere here up to the left where you can

122
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:58,280
switch to the edit mode if you want to add something here. Here we have all the links

123
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:07,160
also to this welcome session and then to the materials and the archive of previous questions

124
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,840
and let's switch to edit mode for a moment then we can scroll down we have our icebreaker question

125
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:22,680
here. Today we have three questions that you can answer. How would you explain your current job to

126
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:29,400
someone in the year 1700? Quite tricky one. For me I think the first one fits best. We have really

127
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:36,600
big complicated machines and I help people use them. So I try to help people use supercomputers

128
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:47,720
and maybe I can add a plus one here or a little dot. What's the best documented

129
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,360
project you have seen? Since we're going to talk about documentation we can pick

130
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:58,400
up on that later. For me I think it's also the scikit-learn documentation that

131
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,120
is really really great if you haven't seen it. Take a look and do you prefer

132
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,880
reading short social media posts or long blogs. And this is now a voting system, so like I added

133
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:19,440
my little O here, I basically added that me too. And here I also prefer

134
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,360
maybe often more longer blogs and also in the code, well more often the longer source code to

135
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:35,360
have everything at once. And then if you go down here, then here you can actually edit your

136
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,680
questions that you have about the upcoming session. So you can see some people already wrote some

137
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,680
here, so you can always ask that during the workshop and instructors will pick it up.

138
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:56,880
workshop. All the materials are linked from the workshop page and you can like come back

139
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,080
to it and look at them and you can also reuse them if you want to for your own workshops.

140
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,600
And we also record this whole workshop. So for some days the recordings will still be

141
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,320
available on Twitch and then after that you can find them on YouTube. There's usually

142
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,280
playlist and then you can look through the lessons and to jump to the lessons that you're interested

143
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:28,120
in. If you need a certificate for this course for university you can find instructions for that on

144
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:35,320
our web page and as mentioned before this session already we have this bring your own code session

145
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,320
so if there was a tool during this workshop that you would like to start using in your own work

146
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:54,320
You can come to these sessions and can take a look at these things with our experts or if you have a question related to tools like SnickMake or whatever.

147
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
They will happen next weekend, the week after Tuesday.

148
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,320
And now I will give over to [name] and [name] for the documentation lesson.

149
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,320
The floor is yours.

150
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,000
Thanks. I will take over the screen share.
