00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,280
Hello and welcome everyone to this CodeRefinery workshop.

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,920
We're going to spend the next six half days together, not one after another, but within

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,280
these next two weeks to learn about fair research software development practices.

4
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:43,560
So just a quick recap of why are we here and who am I. Hi, I'm [name]. I work at

5
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,320
CSC in Finland and I'm connecting today from Lohja in southern Finland.

6
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,400
So Coderfinery is an addition to the general coding classes you might have at university. So

7
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,000
So we are not gonna teach you how to code here,

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
but we are trying to support you

9
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,560
in making your code more reproducible.

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,840
And we found this wonderful graphic here

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,080
by Heidi Seibold to describe

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,200
the Code Refinery Workshop quite well.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,020
So six helpful, partly smaller,

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,800
partly a little bit bigger steps

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,800
that you can go towards more reproducible research,

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,560
getting your files in order,

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,080
finding good names for things, documenting with care

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,240
that we will talk about in week two,

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,400
version control will be the topic of this week,

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,040
then stabilizing the computing environment and software

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,040
and publishing your research outputs

22
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,940
apart from your normal publications,

23
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,320
also publishing your code.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,080
So, and what is Code Refinery?

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,600
We are a Nordic project to teach these kind of basic

26
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,880
scientific computing tools.

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,040
and we are funded by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,320
NAIC.

29
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,600
And we are running this workshop,

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,360
and then we also have a bunch of other partnering workshops

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,040
that we are involved in.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,440
And basically, what we are is a community of research software

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
enthusiasts, and you will meet many of the people that

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
are involved in the project during this workshop

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,960
as instructors or behind the scenes.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,280
You can find all the information on our web page,

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,160
CodeRefinery.org. CodeRefinery in general is a partnership of different universities and

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,680
institutions. From Finland we have Aalto University and CSC. From Denmark we have

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,760
the Center for Humanities Computing and the Danish E-Infrastructure Corporation.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,480
From Sweden we have ENCCS and NAISS. And from Norway NRIS. And if you're interested in joining

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,000
the project you can find all the information in our join page for how for example to join our

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:02,360
chat or the organization of these kind of workshops. Then who is here today? So apart

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,000
from me there's also 10 more course coordinators, instructors and expert helpers, some of

44
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,120
who you will meet during the lessons and they will introduce themselves then at the time.

45
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Then we have about six or more team leaders who are together with their team watching this stream and collaborating on the exercises.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:34,120
And then we have 250 participants from about 25 different countries with many different backgrounds, many different levels.

47
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,960
So, this workshop, how does this work?

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,640
If you have made it here, you are basically ready for this, because this is a live stream.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,480
This is a live streamed workshop.

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,000
Everyone, no matter how you are watching this, you will watch the live stream, where we have

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,360
the instructors talking, showing and showing demos, and interacting with you.

52
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,320
week one there will also be exercises and those you can do in two mainly two ways either on your own

53
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,880
or if you have already gathered a team or you are in a room with a team then you can also do them

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,920
with your team. One thing that is new compared to previous workshops is that we don't have dedicated

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,120
team exercise times in week two but we have a lot of collaboration possibilities with our

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,840
collaborative document and I will show that in a moment. Then we plan on having a minimum of 10

57
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,400
minute breaks every hour. If we ever should forget about that or you think it's time

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
for a break, please let us know. I'll show you in a moment how to do that.

59
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,920
The materials are always available for everyone and are linked from the workshop page.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,760
That's the page where you also registered.

61
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,040
So from there you can find all the links to everything you need.

62
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,560
And then because we are streaming this without any danger of participants appearing in the

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,120
stream, the recordings will be available also right away on Twitch and usually the day after

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,000
latest also on YouTube.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,760
So you can watch something that you missed or watch something again if you want to.

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,680
Then our interaction tool is our collaborative document.

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:42,920
So even though this is a live stream, there is this tool to connect to the instructors

68
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,340
and how we can also connect with you.

69
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,700
So we use it to distribute information to you, show you some links on where you can

70
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,420
find, for example, the material that we are going through right now.

71
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:04,740
And we also use it as a chat and that is maybe for you the most interesting use of the document.

72
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,680
So whenever there's any accessibility issues, you can let us know there.

73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,700
But then also you can ask questions at all times, whatever comes to mind.

74
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:20,840
You can just put in the document and either our instructors will pick it up on the stream

75
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,160
or our team behind the scenes will make sure that your questions get answers.

76
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,440
And you can also answer other people's questions if there is something that you know about.

77
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,960
So let's take a look.

78
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,840
You should all have gotten the link with the registration information.

79
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,260
So when you registered, you got an email, the link was in there, and then you also probably

80
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,560
got another email where this link was also part of.

81
00:06:50,560 --> 00:07:00,760
You can also, okay, and in this document you can find all the important links of this workshop.

82
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,560
You can find the agenda for today with also here behind the welcome and practicalities

83
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,820
the link to the document that I was showing before.

84
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
And then the link to materials for today.

85
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,040
And then we have a little icebreaker for you, which many of you already filled in.

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,200
That's very nice to see.

87
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,400
So let's see if we can do that as well.

88
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,480
I can see that already 102 of you are also online here.

89
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,820
So let's see how that goes.

90
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:34,420
So when you join this document, you'll probably see something like me here, nicely rendered.

91
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,980
But now we want to also add something to this document.

92
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,660
For that, you can usually find this little pen symbol up left.

93
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,700
If you have a slightly different view,

94
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,260
it might also be somewhere up right,

95
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,980
but it's always like this pen or edit symbol.

96
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,820
When we click that, we switch into edit mode.

97
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,420
Then we can scroll around and see,

98
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:02,500
okay, here, this is now the raw text for our rendered document.

99
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,460
We have the links here,

100
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,300
we have the agenda here,

101
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,660
and then we have the icebreaker.

102
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,500
Where are you connecting from and how's the weather there?

103
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,420
Let me add that here also.

104
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,860
I sit in Lohja in Finland,

105
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:24,060
and the weather is sunny with some clouds.

106
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:32,380
Now, you can go also please here and get used to this document.

107
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:39,580
We'll add a few more possibilities here. You can see where others are with these little

108
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,940
markers here, so try to find a line where there's only you. Add some more if you need them.

109
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,100
This is a very good way to now get used to the document because we will use it

110
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,540
throughout the whole course and it's really our main communication channel.

111
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,140
You can see this is going well.

112
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,540
And then we have another question for you,

113
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,100
because today it's all about version control.

114
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,060
So here we want to know how you used git before,

115
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,060
and it is no problem if you have never heard what git is,

116
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,780
then you can put your little O here.

117
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,140
Don't know what git is?

118
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,540
I vote for this one.

119
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:34,060
If you know what it is and have used it and want to specify it a little bit more,

120
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:41,820
so I have, for example, used git via the command line, so I will add my O here.

121
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,940
And if your option is not available here, you can also add it below here and our instructors

122
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:56,220
then get a little view of where you are and where they need to pick you up for this course.

123
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,460
If you then scroll a little bit down.

124
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,180
Um, here you can already ask questions and I see you have

125
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,500
already been very busy asking questions.

126
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,220
About this session, the welcome and practicalities and then when

127
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,660
we later go on to the introduction with version control,

128
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,980
you can ask your questions here.

129
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,100
So yeah, go ahead, add your questions there whenever you

130
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,780
need to.

131
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:32,780
And then you can switch to view mode to see this nicely rendered version.

132
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,780
And usually we suggest whenever you're not editing to switch to this view mode.

133
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Okay, so that was the collaborative document.

134
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,780
And we ask you to please not use the Twitch chat for any questions about the content,

135
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,780
because we will not be watching this.

136
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,460
We'll collect all the questions in this collaborative document.

137
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,780
OK, I've shown this.

138
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,220
Then practical set up for the workshop.

139
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,140
One thing that we would suggest you to do, you don't have to,

140
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,980
but we suggest you to create a directory or folder

141
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,100
for this course on your computer.

142
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,740
In that way, you can have all the exercise material in one place,

143
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,860
and that makes it much easier to clean up later.

144
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,760
So that is a good thing to do right now,

145
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,280
while you're listening with one ear

146
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,520
to what I have to tell here

147
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,160
during the next few minutes still.

148
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,720
Then you might have noticed that within Twitch,

149
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,960
we are sharing a vertical window.

150
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,880
So that means it is quite nice for you

151
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,800
that you can give half the screen to us

152
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,180
with the Twitch view.

153
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,120
And then the other half is for you

154
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,160
where you can keep open, for example,

155
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,560
the collaborative document to ask questions.

156
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,560
If you are doing the exercises,

157
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,680
you can keep your terminal or your browser open.

158
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,460
In that way, you can even

159
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,600
participate in this course with only a laptop screen.

160
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,480
For Twitch, you can hide the chat and then use

161
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,480
the theater mode to have it in this kind of setup,

162
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,980
and all of our instructors will share it this way.

163
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,160
Okay, now you might say,

164
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,840
oh, this is so much information,

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,840
so much things that I need to keep track of.

166
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,680
So where to focus?

167
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,400
Well, your first priority should be the live stream.

168
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,520
This is where everything happens.

169
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,960
Then whenever you have a question,

170
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,200
it's good to have the collaborative document there.

171
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,920
And then the lesson material webpage,

172
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,860
you usually don't need much.

173
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,400
It's good to have it open.

174
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,560
So if you missed like a command or something,

175
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,440
you can check it up there,

176
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,780
but you don't need to have it open at all times

177
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,500
if it's all too much to do at the same time.

178
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,140
And if you know some of the materials already

179
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,020
that we were presenting here,

180
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,380
then please help us also answering the question

181
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,700
in the collaborative document,

182
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,860
because as you have seen, we have about 250 people here.

183
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,820
So in order to give everyone the answers

184
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,340
and maybe even discuss some different viewpoints

185
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,340
about questions, please help us fill in here.

186
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,120
And for that, please keep in mind

187
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,180
that everyone is at different level

188
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,360
and that's also expected.

189
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,120
We have this course open for everyone.

190
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,300
So everyone is also both a teacher and a learner.

191
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,440
And when here on stream,

192
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
something isn't quite going right,

193
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,440
like some issues with audio or any of these things,

194
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,680
then you can always use the collaborative document

195
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,840
to let us know quickly.

196
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,320
And then also the instructors will get to know about it.

197
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,840
We have a code of conduct in place

198
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,560
that you can find behind this link here.

199
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,200
And there's also a form to fill out

200
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,900
if there has been violations of the code of conduct.

201
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,640
We have a few things that can

202
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,840
and quite possibly will go wrong in this course.

203
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,280
One are these accessibility problems.

204
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,840
So we have tried to do a sound check,

205
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,360
but it might always happen that a microphone

206
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,200
does something weird or something.

207
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,480
Let us know as quickly as possible

208
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
if you notice anything like this,

209
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,300
or if the font is not big enough or these kinds of things.

210
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,360
Then also our instructors are only human

211
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,040
and they might make mistakes.

212
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,700
No one knows everything.

213
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Seeing how these mistakes happen and how they can get fixed

214
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,580
is also really part of this course.

215
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,300
It's part of the pedagogy of this course.

216
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,660
So please, be nice to everyone.

217
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,660
If you get overloaded with information, don't worry.

218
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,500
You can change your watching style,

219
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,260
meaning you can even step away from the computer for a while,

220
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,540
get back, and use the replay function in Twitch

221
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,180
to watch where you left off.

222
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,940
If the collaborative document gets too fast to follow,

223
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,300
you noticed it already now during the icebreaker,

224
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,420
it can get quite chaotic, then just leave it be.

225
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,420
And you can always look at it later.

226
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,460
If you have a question, you can put it there

227
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,220
and then put it aside and come back later

228
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,880
to review the answers to the questions.

229
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,280
Sometimes it may also be that we cannot solve your problem

230
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,800
because there is something deeper than what we have access

231
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,060
to via the collaborative document.

232
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,680
Then it's good to contact your local IT support,

233
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,920
for example, or if you are in a team room

234
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,320
to ask your helper in the break

235
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,440
or after the course for some help.

236
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,480
We also have this bring your own code sessions

237
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,640
every Tuesday after this workshop for two times.

238
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,200
You can find it in the schedule

239
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,700
where we can look at these kinds of issues.

240
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:12,720
And you can always watch the materials also without doing any exercises.

241
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,880
If we deviate from the schedule, then it's probably something that didn't go as planned.

242
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,360
And then we try to leave out some subtopic that maybe is not that important.

243
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,720
But the material is there for you, so you can review it if this is an important topic

244
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,640
for you that we might have to leave out.

245
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,840
But we try, of course, our best to stay on track.

246
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:41,880
Then it might be that the collaborative document lags and text goes wrong or everything looks

247
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,960
somehow weird.

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,880
That can happen with very high load if really everyone tries to do something at the same

249
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
time.

250
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,520
So, please, everyone, then switch to view mode and wait for it for a moment to calm

251
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
down.

252
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,640
So that's why it's always good to keep it also in view mode when you are not editing

253
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,380
it.

254
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:10,000
And then we also have our colleagues in the background that will move stuff of the document

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,680
to an archive so that we can keep the active document quite short.

256
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,800
If the stream suddenly dies, that can also happen.

257
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,960
We have [name] here, our broadcaster, and if his computer just decides to give up, then

258
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:36,440
just wait a moment, and we will resume in about five minutes to get it set back up.

259
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:44,000
Then for the exercises, it's important that you have some software set up and configured,

260
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,040
and if you haven't done that, it's okay.

261
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,260
You can just watch and see how other people are working it and maybe fix it for the next

262
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
day.

263
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,740
And we have installation instructions to see what might be missing or how you can get the

264
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,680
parts together.

265
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,660
If you can't attend every day, it's not a problem.

266
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,900
You can always just attend the parts that you are interested in or where you don't have

267
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,620
other meetings or anything like that.

268
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,500
The materials are always available.

269
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,820
The videos are also available.

270
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,260
have cats visiting some of the instructors, then everyone just stay calm and wait for a moment

271
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,500
till the danger passes. And if the course is too cool and you want to know more,

272
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,860
then we will have some hints for you in the workshop outro in the end of day six. You can,

273
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,780
for example, join as a team leader next time or advertise to your organization to become a

274
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,700
partner of the Code Refinery Workshop. And then before we jump into version control,

275
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:51,700
some final notes. Please register if you haven't yet. That means that you will get emails from us

276
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,900
with updates about what happened every day and what needs to be done in preparation for the next

277
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:04,500
day. It helps us with our reporting. And you will also get the link to the collaborative document,

278
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:12,740
for example, and the registration goes via the workshop page. About privacy, since we are here

279
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,940
on stream, only the instructors, there's no way for your audio or video to end up broadcasted or

280
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:24,420
recorded. The only way where this can happen is via our collaborative documents, so that's why

281
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,820
we ask you to not put any names or identifiable info in this collaborative document, because

282
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,940
instructors may show it to answer some of your questions, for example, and that will end up on

283
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:45,380
stream. And the contents of the document will be screened after every course day and then they will

284
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,500
be posted on the course page. So then it is definitely without names, but it makes our

285
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,740
tasks easier if you don't put them there in the first place. And then if you would like a

286
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,580
certificate for the course. I think I've seen already a question about that also in the

287
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,820
collaborative documents. In the local teams at universities, for example, ask from your team

288
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,500
leader and then you can find some general instructions for these certificates behind

289
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:22,580
this link on our work page. And then once more CodeRefiner is an open project, you can get

290
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:29,380
involved you can join our chat. We have some manuals on how we organize these workshops and

291
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:35,460
we always need volunteers and partners to continue making this also a success in the future and we

292
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,500
are very happy to also welcome new institutional partners. And then if you like this workshop

293
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:51,300
please share your experiences about it on social media with this Code Refinery hashtag and we are

294
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,660
are also on Mustard on Twitter and LinkedIn.

295
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,020
And now I've already taken a few too many minutes,

296
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,180
so I will give over right away to [name] and [name],

297
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,180
who will guide you to our first steps into version control.
