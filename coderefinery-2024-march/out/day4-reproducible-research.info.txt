4.2 Reproducible Research - CodeRefinery 2024 Mar

If you can't get your code to do the same thing again, is it really science?  Or more practically, are you able to do your work?  Reproducibilty is a big deal, but we don't always learn how to do it.  In this lesson, we cover the basics, how to organize projects, record computational steps with Snakemake or other workflow managers, how to record environments with conda (and containers a bit), and sharing code and data (FAIR).

This is part of the CodeRefinery March 2024 workshop.  The videos are available to everyone, but may be most useful to the people who attended the workshop and want to review later.  In this workshop, week 1 was redesigned and day 1 starts with concepts in the GitHub web interface, and days 2-3 move to local work.
