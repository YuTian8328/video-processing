1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
We'd like to get feedback for today.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,720
So we do have a little bit more, so don't leave yet.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,960
We have an outro session.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,000
And also, we plan on talking.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,520
There are some requests to talk a little bit about AI code

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,960
generation and things like that.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,640
that. Should we talk about the AI code stuff first? So what are the specific

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,520
questions? Maybe we can add a section? Yeah.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,560
Let's see, what do people think here?

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,240
What should we talk about, if anything?

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,680
So who uses AI to make code?

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,560
I must say that I do not right now.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:01:00,000
I have now started using it all the time, since my employer is providing the license,

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
and then why not?

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,760
So yeah, GitHub Copilot.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,720
So how does it work?

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,800
It essentially makes suggestions based on the code you have right now.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,000
There is a chat interface as well, so you can ask it to write some code that does X.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,480
But the interface that works better actually is usually the code completions.

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,000
It's mainly like there's always been this code completion systems that try to guess

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,240
the kind of code you would want to add and allow you to, for example, write in languages

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,200
that have more boilerplate code, create a class, like write all the boilerplate code

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:03,080
for a class with a couple of, typing a couple of keystrokes, and Copilot is doing a lot

24
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:10,520
of that for me. I see. It's like all the standard ARC parse stuff that I'd always be making. Yeah.

25
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,680
Yeah. Okay. But it goes a little bit beyond, but it cannot do anything

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,160
really new or really complicated. So it's just this basic, relatively basic things.

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,760
It will usually have a suggestion for even more complicated things, but it's more often than not

28
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,960
not that you just have to go and change a lot of things. It's only the basic structure

29
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:45,600
that's correct. But it's still doing a lot of work, though. I don't know, how would

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:03:00,160
I evaluate? How much time is it saving? 50% or a bit more of actual coding time?

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah. What's the license of the generated code?

32
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:15,520
For Copilot it's essentially they just give you the copyright as long as you know

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:25,840
as the usual warning is it might in some I think relatively rare cases output code that is an exact

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,800
copy of something that already is out there. In fact, it will do that very often if you

35
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,640
take something really simple, but that's just like you would type it out by hand in exactly

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,040
the same way anyway. So that code is very structured. So there's a lot of exact copies

37
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,840
out there. But yeah, I mean, at some point when it gets complicated enough, you have to

38
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,840
You have to know yourself that it's not a copy of something.

39
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,840
And that's a big caveat.

40
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,840
But yeah, otherwise, usually they just give you the copyright,

41
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,840
because otherwise the service model wouldn't really make a lot of sense.

42
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:16,840
So, I heard that we should do the outro before this discussion, too, before people leave.

43
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,840
So, okay, mix that up.

44
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:26,840
So, [name], would you like to grab the screen and summarize everything for us and tell us what we should do next?

45
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,840
Yes, hello.

46
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Okay.

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
Hello, hello. Can you hear me all right?

48
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Yes.

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:42,600
and can you see my screen? Yes I can see it's now also on the stream. Okay thank

50
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,240
you very much [name] and [name] for this very interesting session. So this was now

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,320
the very last session of our workshop but it's not the very last thing

52
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,920
that you can join for this course. So stay with me for a moment to tell you

53
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:07,840
more about that. So this was the Code Refinery workshop for this spring. We would like to

54
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,800
thank you, the participants, very much for participating, putting so many questions and

55
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,720
so good feedback after each day in our collaborative document and discussing the questions and like

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,140
being very active there. We'd also like to thank our team leaders and hosts that have

57
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:35,700
made this possible to spread to even more people and provide more personal support to some of our

58
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:43,140
participants here. Then also a very big thank you to all of our instructors of this workshop. It was

59
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:52,020
a quite big group this time. I think it went all in all very well. Then we also had some

60
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,140
Some people working in the background that have so far never appeared on stream that

61
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:07,500
were answering the questions in the collaborative document in addition to the instructors.

62
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,560
And then we also had some local partners that hosted the rooms there and answered questions.

63
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,060
So you all make these workshops possible and so enjoyable.

64
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,500
Thank you very much.

65
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:27,100
[name] and [name] have already told you about the feedback section, so if you go to the

66
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:33,660
collaborative document and in the very bottom we have our feedback, a little bit about today

67
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,220
and then you can also let us know what you thought overall about this workshop, no matter

68
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,700
if you joined all the days or just a few of them, like let us know how you like this workshop,

69
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,220
you like this format, things that we can do better, things that you really much like

70
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,640
that we should not get rid of, and all these kind of things.

71
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,020
And if you come up with something later, you can also send us an email to support.coderefinery.org.

72
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,620
Or you can also, and you are all very welcome to, also without feedback, join our chat.

73
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,060
It's on Zulip.

74
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,300
So you can find this behind the link.

75
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,200
Actually, is this document linked from the collaborative document?

76
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,120
If not, I would like to ask one of my colleagues here to link that so that you can click those

77
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,720
links also.

78
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,880
Then if you have struggled with some of the exercise instructions or found some broken

79
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,720
links or have some update suggestions for our lesson material, now during the first

80
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,600
week of this course, you have learned how to do issues, pull requests, so you can practice

81
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:50,160
that on our lesson material and we are very happy to get also like feedback that way and we are

82
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,840
always at least trying to develop this workshop materials further latest before the next workshop

83
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,640
so we are really relying on your feedback here and also we will take a look at the

84
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,000
questions that you ask and see if we can improve the material to make these things more clear.

85
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:23,600
At some point in the future you will likely receive a post-workshop survey that is then about how your work in the long run has been affected by visiting this workshop.

86
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:32,600
So we know that there is like a lot of topics here and it's a lot of things to take in at such a short time.

87
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:42,600
But maybe after like a few weeks, you may get back to some of the topics and you may get an understanding to where these topics can help you in your work.

88
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
So that's why it will take some time before you will get this workshop, but it will come.

89
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:55,600
And if you get it, then please answer it. That helps us a lot to continue the work that we are doing.

90
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,640
Yeah, because it has been a lot of material, a lot of possibly new concepts for you.

91
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,000
This is just a starting point and there is so much more to learn and dig into.

92
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,240
You may have noticed in this week too that we tried to show some of the exercises on

93
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,760
stream, but there were also in many lessons, many more exercises that we did not go through.

94
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,640
So you can go back to the material, look through them, try to do them yourself.

95
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,920
And if you do that within the next two weeks and you have some trouble with this, you can

96
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,380
also come to our bring your own code sessions.

97
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:39,880
And this is also if you have some more questions like we had this morning, for example, for

98
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,760
the automated testing, many people were asking something about like how to do this, how to

99
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,800
apply this to your own code.

100
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,160
If you have questions like this, then this bring your own code sessions are a very good

101
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
place to come.

102
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,780
Many of our instructors will be there, and we will try to help you further with the topics

103
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,180
discussed in this workshop.

104
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:13,100
So it's the next Tuesdays, 1, 2, 3, and the link will be sent to all registered participants.

105
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,620
As mentioned many times already, our materials are publicly available.

106
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,380
are all open source and will continue to be updated. You can also reuse them for your

107
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:32,220
own workshops and this link leads you to the main overview of all the lessons. So there's not just

108
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,900
the lessons that we went through here in this workshop, but there's also a few more there.

109
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,420
So you can go and take a look. The videos will stay on YouTube, you can always like re-watch

110
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,900
them. They also have these little nice section tags that you can jump around to the topics that

111
00:10:49,900 --> 00:11:01,260
are of interest to you. And then we have a lot of local partners that provide support

112
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:10,860
with the topics around this workshop. And you can find the list of the partners here

113
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:17,740
for Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Many also with their link to the training calendar

114
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:24,060
where there is like further training going more into high performance computing or

115
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,660
I don't know what we other have, scientific computing with Python and these kind of things.

116
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,980
So you can check them out and some of them are also not necessarily only for the group for example

117
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,500
at Aalto University in Finland, but some of these trainings are also open for all.

118
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,460
So even if you are not in these areas, I would recommend to check out the training calendars of

119
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:57,740
these institutions. And then again, a reminder about the certificates. If you want one,

120
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:06,540
check out the course web page, you can do that briefly. Up top you can find this tab to

121
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,460
certificates, if you click that there's instructions on what you can do to get a certificate for this

122
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:25,980
course. And then how you can support us, so we are a project and it always helps to like tell

123
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:31,980
everyone about us, tell your friends if you like this course, tell them about our materials,

124
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,900
our webpage, use our social media handles. We have been trying to post a little bit about this

125
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:46,460
workshop too, so use those to re-share your experience about it. We are also eagerly reading

126
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:55,660
these posts, so please make use of that. And we will probably have more workshops of this type

127
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,220
further developed in some way, so you can always come back as a team leader, for example,

128
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:07,420
so you can bring your colleagues, sit together in a room and watch the stream together and then do

129
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,020
the exercises together, for example, like some of you have already done. And then you can also

130
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,620
become part of the Code Refinery team. In general, the project lives currently still from

131
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,940
in-kind contributions by the organizations, meaning that our organizations sponsor our time

132
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,340
for the project. So if that is something that sounds interesting to you and especially your

133
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:39,180
organization, please get in touch. As mentioned, we live in the chat, so that's where really

134
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,180
everything goes, where we also have a nice help channel where you can add your questions that you

135
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,260
have for example surrounding this workshop or also later when you implement these things you can

136
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:57,900
go and ask for help there's a lot of so-called research software engineers especially around that

137
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:06,620
really enjoy helping people with their computational research challenges and then we also have a

138
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:14,380
newsletter about once or twice a year where we update about upcoming workshops or this we recently

139
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:21,020
switched our newsletter provider, so let's hope this goes well. You can find the link

140
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,620
on our webpage behind the newsletter. And then I mentioned already this research software

141
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:34,720
engineers, so many of our instructors are actually research software engineers and we

142
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:43,120
also have an association, the Nordic Research Software Engineers, where you can find the

143
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:56,800
link behind this one here. I think it's just nordic-rse.org. Let's see. And so the research

144
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,520
software engineers, they are like these people that are between the researchers and the software

145
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:10,880
developers that combine this experience of both of these worlds. And basically, the code refinery

146
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,440
workshop could be also called like a introduction to research software engineering. So if you liked

147
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,960
what you learned here and would like to go further in that, then the Nordic RSE community is a very

148
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,960
nice place to be in. Basically we live also in the same chat as Code Refinery

149
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,480
in the Nordic RSE channel. We sometimes have some like seminar series and upcoming now also

150
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,920
So a conference in Espoo in Finland in the end of May that you can still submit contributions

151
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,560
to that you can still come and join us for.

152
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,200
And we are also on Twitter X, sorry.

153
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,840
And that was it with the wrap up.

154
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:03,640
Do my fellow colleagues here on call still have to add something to this?

155
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:11,720
other upcoming courses do we have? Someone commented on that in the feedback.

156
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:21,920
Yes, I guess the next one that is by some of the code refinery community is the

157
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,000
tools and techniques, Tuesday's tools and techniques for HPC, but we don't have a

158
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,880
event page for that yet. It will come up in April and you can probably find these

159
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,880
information soon on the Aalto training page, I would guess.

160
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:49,920
So, the other courses of the similar form, in the beginning of June, we have a live stream

161
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,480
kickstart course, mainly hosted by Aalto University, but each year some others join.

162
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,480
And it's about scaling your work from your local things to a computer cluster.

163
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:17,360
And, ah, okay, I'm under attack.

164
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:26,520
So okay, well at least you get some entertainment

165
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:34,920
Yeah, and then in the autumn, we have a yearly Python for Scientific Computing course,

166
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,840
which is quite similar to what we're doing here. And who knows, maybe more in the future.

167
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,280
Through Code Refinery, sometimes we advertise other courses by partners,

168
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,040
which should be of similar quality.

169
00:17:50,040 --> 00:18:02,240
Should we go back to the notes? Yes. What other? So one of the biggest changes we've had is we

170
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,560
made the second week more demo-based rather than exercise-based, and we'd like your comments on

171
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:16,240
that. So part of the reason was that we didn't have as many exercises the second week anyway,

172
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,840
So when people came prepared for exercises, then there were not enough

173
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,000
and helpers, the people who were prepared to help with the exercises, didn't have

174
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,360
enough to do. So, yeah.

175
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:47,480
Yeah.

176
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Any other comments?

177
00:18:48,480 --> 00:19:01,600
Do any other instructors want to join here and give general questions and answers?

178
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:13,920
Yeah. Should we? Oh, [name] is here. Do you have any thoughts on AI coding?

179
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:22,040
Yeah, first of all, thanks for today. I was watching it and I was typing. Really enjoyed

180
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:28,120
the many questions. I had to really type a lot. It was really cool today. Yeah, I mean,

181
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,560
AI coding exists, it's an important tool.

182
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,440
Do you use AI coding much?

183
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,400
Yes, I do.

184
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,640
Okay.

185
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,600
I do, so AI-assisted coding.

186
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
Sometimes I write comments and then it tries to code,

187
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,960
or I write a code and it tries the comments for me,

188
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,720
or I ask it to write a test,

189
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,320
or I write the test first and ask it to write the code

190
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,440
that matches the test.

191
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
It saves a lot of time.

192
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,120
There were a few questions and points about translating.

193
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,120
And that's kind of one way of thinking about what these AI models are really good at.

194
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,120
It's essentially, well, I guess there's two big things.

195
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,120
And one is translating from one format to another.

196
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,120
So that would include also taking a code

197
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
and writing tests for it,

198
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,400
or taking a test and writing code that fulfills that test.

199
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,040
And like sort of trying to go from one type

200
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,320
of information to another,

201
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,480
or just going from one language to another.

202
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,840
Yeah, and that works really well.

203
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,560
So I, for instance, I'm now learning R.

204
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,360
So I'm a beginner in R.

205
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,680
So what I've tried a few times

206
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,080
is that I have a Python code and I ask it to translate it

207
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,280
to R and then I have a really good starting point.

208
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,440
So it can help me actually learn the language.

209
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,480
I can see like, okay, this is something that works

210
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,200
and I can study it and I can improve it

211
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,560
and maybe it's not perfect,

212
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,440
but I believe that it can also help beginners

213
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,000
to get started and learn coding.

214
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,160
So the other big thing that it's really good at

215
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,480
is just remembering stuff.

216
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,920
So it's like, in principle, Google also is useful

217
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,760
for finding any, or any web search is good

218
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,060
for finding all of the same information

219
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:32,060
but this is more integrated to the actual coding workflow.

220
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,280
So it can not just find the documentation for some library

221
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,280
but actually suggest how to use it in your code.

222
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,920
Although the information does tend to be old pretty quickly.

223
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,820
So you have to take that into account.

224
00:21:48,480 --> 00:22:01,240
Yeah.

225
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,440
So from the whole workshop, what are your main takeaway messages that you'd like people

226
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,720
to carry with them.

227
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:31,520
Anyone? Version control is super useful. It makes everything possible. Yeah.

228
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:41,380
Everything runs on top of version control and publishing your code as early as possible

229
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:52,720
is relatively, it's easy and it enables a lot of useful things.

230
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,000
What do you mean by publishing as soon as possible?

231
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,680
You mean putting on, like making it available by GitHub or similar?

232
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,680
Yeah, or at least putting it online somewhere, and preferably with a license.

233
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Yeah, because GitHub and many of these platforms, they provide free stuff to public projects, usually.

234
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,680
So the sooner you go public, the sooner you can start using these.

235
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:36,600
Okay, does anyone else have any other comments in the notes?

236
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,920
Or should we wrap it up?

237
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,880
I see a question from earlier, where to find more resources and examples on modular development

238
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,360
in testing for research?

239
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:58,760
What would you say there?

240
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,520
It's a great question.

241
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,520
I'm not sure there is this like one resource for it.

242
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Yeah.

243
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
I would study.

244
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,080
Have a look at the code that you are using.

245
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,360
And how do they do testing?

246
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,200
How do they structure their code?

247
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,360
But it can be a little bit too big.

248
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,440
So maybe look at the smaller projects.

249
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,040
Have a look at other projects, how they do it.

250
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm not aware of one book that will discuss this in one place.

251
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,880
Are you aware of any other things that cover these topics specifically for research in

252
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,720
this much or more detail?

253
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Did most researchers sort of figure this out themselves, or how does it go?

254
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
I mean, I really don't know.

255
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,760
I learned this sort of by following other projects and having to figure it out myself.

256
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,000
So that's why I like this course so much, because it can save other people that effort.

257
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,560
I have a feeling that still a lot of it is figuring it out yourself, but at least you

258
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:22,180
see the vision and, well, if our audience is researchers, then you're good at figuring

259
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
out new things.

260
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:37,360
So as long as you know what to look for, you can find and adapt.

261
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,440
There are a couple of papers that are nice, which is this Ten Simple Rules to etc. etc.

262
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,360
Ten Simple Rules to Make Your Code More.

263
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,320
Oh, they are nice.

264
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
They are good summaries.

265
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
Yeah.

266
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,760
And I guess it would be nice if we made a collection and listed all of them.

267
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,120
There's a link to a book called The Turing Way, which I know about.

268
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:12,440
it cover the details of coding? I see chapters on code testing, code review, and so on. So

269
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,320
I guess that would be a good thing to look at that goes into some good depth.

270
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:36,160
Yeah, okay, should we call it good then?

271
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,960
We're almost at the hour now.

272
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,880
So thanks to everyone who attended.

273
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:56,080
Yeah, I can just say we will send an email to everybody with some summary. We don't forget

274
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:02,600
that in a week. So next Tuesday, the Tuesday after, you can show up at the sessions, bring

275
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,200
your code, bring your questions, it will be on zoom, it will not be recorded, not streamed.

276
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,320
We will email you the connection details. And I hope people show up and that we can

277
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,320
and show up with questions.

278
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Yes.

279
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Okay.

280
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Well.

281
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:27,840
Should I hang it up then?

282
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,320
Thanks a lot and good luck in your future research.

283
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Thanks everybody.

284
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
See you soon.

285
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Thank you.

286
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Thank you.

287
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Bye.

288
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
Bye.

289
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,820
Bye.
