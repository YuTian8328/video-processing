1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,440
Okay, there you go.

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,040
Thank you very much [Name] and good morning and welcome everyone to this third day of

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,200
the CodeRefinery workshop.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,840
Today is the last day for this week and the last day that we will be focused solely on

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,440
version control. Next week we will be jumping into all kinds of topics around research software

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,320
development. So first a quick recap of day one and two, the introduction to version control,

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:46,920
we learned about version control, what it is, why it exists and how it can be useful,

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,280
how to do commits, clone and fork repositories, about branches and how they can be merged.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:08,280
We also learned how to move from working in the GitHub web interface on the Internet to your local environment and how to work with Git, depending on how you follow the workshop on the command line on VS Code or RStudio.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:19,280
So now for day three, we will be working collaboratively, and that means with others or also yourself using Git.

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,600
So, the topic of today is Collaborative Distributed Version Control.

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,240
And here, the materials are building from things that you learned in day one and two,

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,200
so be prepared to also look back into the Git intro lesson if there's concepts that

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,720
you maybe need to look up again.

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,720
But if you are joining us for the first time today and you know the basic concepts of Git,

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,480
will also be very well prepared to follow the exercises and also the lesson materials.

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:00,240
For the hands-on exercises you need to make sure that your authentication to GitHub is working

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,480
so you can check this in the installation instructions and that is when you are working

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,000
on your own computer but many of the things you can also do just from the GitHub web interface.

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,800
And today it really all comes together.

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,680
So everything that we learned in day one and two

22
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,500
will be present in today's exercises.

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,960
This also means that it might be harder to follow

24
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,040
if you really just learned about version control,

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,360
but please don't give up.

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,720
If it's going too fast,

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,120
if there is too many new concepts popping up here and there,

28
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,880
then just like take a step back,

29
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,160
try to follow as you can

30
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,200
and remember that you can always come back

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,980
and review as necessary.

32
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,220
If you're joining today for the first time,

33
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,320
just briefly how this workshop works.

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,640
So everyone watches the live stream,

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,720
the thing you're watching now on Twitch.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,720
We will have exercises that you can do

37
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,720
either in your own teams that you are maybe in right now,

38
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,080
or if you don't have a team,

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,980
then you can also do them on your own.

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,980
And we will have a minimum of 10 minutes break on every hour.

41
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:24,980
For communication from you with the instructors, but also the instructors to you, we use a collaborative document.

42
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:31,980
And if you registered, you got the link in the email that you got after registering.

43
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,980
And that looks something like this.

44
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,480
And here you can see all the important links that you need for this workshop.

45
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,980
The agenda with the links also for example to the material I just showed behind this short welcome and practicalities.

46
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:59,980
And then we have an icebreaker and the way we can answer that icebreaker is we find this little pen symbol which might be up here or somewhere up to the right with some edit.

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:10,980
You can click that. That changes you into edit mode. Then we can scroll down here and answer, for example, the question, what you had for breakfast.

48
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:24,980
I had some bread with some cheese. And you can also do that now. Just add another line here and put in what you had.

49
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:30,740
had and then what has been the most collaborative project so far. As mentioned before already

50
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:41,860
mine is code refinery materials. Mostly I'm working on my own and then we have here the

51
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,820
question and answer section so whenever during the day you have a question you can put it here

52
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,140
in the collaborative document and the instructors will have a look at it and then we also have a

53
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:59,140
a whole team behind the scenes, which will answer your questions here.

54
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:06,740
And the lesson materials are available, will stay available, and are linked from the workshop

55
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,240
web page.

56
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,780
And then the recordings will be available on Twitch for some days still, and then will

57
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,940
go on the Code Refinery YouTube channel.

58
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,940
We have also updated our instructions for the certificates, which is also linked from

59
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,100
the Code Refinery Workshop page.

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,140
If you go on that one,

61
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,180
you can find the link to certificates up

62
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,300
here and find the instructions there.

63
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,100
Then one small reminder that on March 26th and April 2nd,

64
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,540
we have Bring Your Own Code session,

65
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,500
where you can really bring your own code or bring

66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,780
your own project and get some help from

67
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,100
our experts in implementing

68
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,460
the concepts that you learn here in the course.

69
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,380
Also, the version control, for example,

70
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,540
if you have some bigger, more in-depth question about it.

71
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,080
And now I will give over to our instructors for today,

72
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,920
which are [Name] and [Name].
