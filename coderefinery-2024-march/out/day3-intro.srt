one and two, so be prepared to also look back

7
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,160
into the Git intro lesson if there is concepts

8
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,240
that you maybe need to look up again.

9
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,580
But if you are joining us for the first time today

10
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,640
and you know the basic concepts of Git,

11
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,920
then you will also be very well prepared

12
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,360
to follow the exercises and also the lesson materials.

13
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
For the hands-on exercises,

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,920
you need to make sure that your authentication to GitHub is working so you can check this in

15
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:10,320
the installation instructions and that is when you are working on your own computer.

16
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,000
But many of the things you can also do just from the GitHub web interface.

17
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,400
And today it really all comes together so everything that we learned in day one and two

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,640
You will be present in today's exercises.

19
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,080
This also means that it might be harder to follow if you really just learned about version

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,520
control, but please don't give up.

21
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,280
If it's going too fast, if there is too many new concepts popping up here and there, then

22
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,900
just take a step back, try to follow as you can, and remember that you can always come

23
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,560
back and review as necessary.

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,720
are joining today for the first time just briefly how this workshop works. So everyone watches the

25
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,640
live stream, the thing you're watching now on Twitch. We will have exercises that you can do

26
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,720
either in your own teams that you have that you are maybe in right now or if you don't have a

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,280
team then you can also do them on your own. And we will have a minimum of 10 minutes break on every

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:23,120
hour. For communication from you with the instructors but also the instructors to you,

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,000
we use a collaborative document and if you registered you got the link in the email

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,840
that you got after registering and that looks something like this.

31
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,360
And here you can see all the important links that you need for this workshop,

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,280
the agenda with the links also for example to the material I just showed behind this short

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,640
welcome and practicalities. And then we have an icebreaker and the way we can answer that icebreaker

34
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,760
is we find this little pen symbol which might be up here or somewhere up to the right with some edit.

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,320
You can click that, that changes you into edit mode. Then we can scroll down here and answer

36
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,480
for example, the question what you had for breakfast, I had some bread with some cheese.

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:25,720
And you can also do that now, just add another line here and put in what you had. And then

38
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,040
what has been the most collaborative project so far? As mentioned before already, mine

39
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:42,240
is code refinery materials. Mostly I'm working on my own. And then we have here the question

40
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,840
and answer section. So whenever during the day you have a question, you can put it here

41
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,120
in the collaborative document and the instructors will have a look at it. And then we also have

42
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,680
a whole team behind the scenes which will answer your questions here.

43
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,040
And the lesson materials are available, will stay available and are linked from the

44
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,600
workshop web page and then the recordings will be available on Twitch for some days still and then

45
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,520
will go on the Code Refinery YouTube channel. We have also updated our instructions for the

46
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,000
certificates, which is also linked from the Code Refinery Workshop page. If you go on that one,

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,480
you can find the link to certificates up here and find the instructions there.

48
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,080
And then one small reminder that on March 26th and April 2nd, we have Bring Your Own Code session,

49
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,920
where you can really bring your own code or bring your own project and get some help from

50
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,800
our experts in implementing the concepts that you learn here in the course. Also,

51
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,400
or the version control, for example,

52
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,560
if you have some bigger, more in-depth question about it.

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,080
And now I will give over to our instructors for today,

54
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,920
which are [Name] and [Name].
