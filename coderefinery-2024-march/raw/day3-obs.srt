one and two, so be prepared to also look back

29
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,160
into the Git intro lesson if there is concepts

30
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,240
that you maybe need to look up again.

31
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,580
But if you are joining us for the first time today

32
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,640
and you know the basic concepts of Git,

33
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,920
then you will also be very well prepared

34
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,360
to follow the exercises and also the lesson materials.

35
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,920
For the hands-on exercises,

36
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:57,920
you need to make sure that your authentication to GitHub is working so you can check this in

37
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:06,320
the installation instructions and that is when you are working on your own computer.

38
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,000
But many of the things you can also do just from the GitHub web interface.

39
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,400
And today it really all comes together so everything that we learned in day one and two

40
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,640
You will be present in today's exercises.

41
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,080
This also means that it might be harder to follow if you really just learned about version

42
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,520
control, but please don't give up.

43
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,280
If it's going too fast, if there is too many new concepts popping up here and there, then

44
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,900
just take a step back, try to follow as you can, and remember that you can always come

45
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,560
back and review as necessary.

46
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,720
are joining today for the first time just briefly how this workshop works. So everyone watches the

47
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,640
live stream, the thing you're watching now on Twitch. We will have exercises that you can do

48
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,720
either in your own teams that you have that you are maybe in right now or if you don't have a

49
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,280
team then you can also do them on your own. And we will have a minimum of 10 minutes break on every

50
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:19,120
hour. For communication from you with the instructors but also the instructors to you,

51
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,000
we use a collaborative document and if you registered you got the link in the email

52
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,840
that you got after registering and that looks something like this.

53
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,360
And here you can see all the important links that you need for this workshop,

54
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,280
the agenda with the links also for example to the material I just showed behind this short

55
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:50,640
welcome and practicalities. And then we have an icebreaker and the way we can answer that icebreaker

56
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,760
is we find this little pen symbol which might be up here or somewhere up to the right with some edit.

57
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,320
You can click that, that changes you into edit mode. Then we can scroll down here and answer

58
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:12,480
for example, the question what you had for breakfast, I had some bread with some cheese.

59
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:21,720
And you can also do that now, just add another line here and put in what you had. And then

60
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,040
what has been the most collaborative project so far? As mentioned before already, mine

61
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:38,240
is code refinery materials. Mostly I'm working on my own. And then we have here the question

62
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,840
and answer section. So whenever during the day you have a question, you can put it here

63
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,120
in the collaborative document and the instructors will have a look at it. And then we also have

64
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,680
a whole team behind the scenes which will answer your questions here.

65
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:01,040
And the lesson materials are available, will stay available and are linked from the

66
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:07,600
workshop web page and then the recordings will be available on Twitch for some days still and then

67
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,520
will go on the Code Refinery YouTube channel. We have also updated our instructions for the

68
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:20,000
certificates, which is also linked from the Code Refinery Workshop page. If you go on that one,

69
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,480
you can find the link to certificates up here and find the instructions there.

70
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,080
And then one small reminder that on March 26th and April 2nd, we have Bring Your Own Code session,

71
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,920
where you can really bring your own code or bring your own project and get some help from

72
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,800
our experts in implementing the concepts that you learn here in the course. Also,

73
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,400
or the version control, for example,

74
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,560
if you have some bigger, more in-depth question about it.

75
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,080
And now I will give over to our instructors for today,

76
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,920
which are [Name] and [Name].

77
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,000
Thanks, [Name].

78
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,820
Let me take a screen,

79
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,560
and then we will start by saying hi and who we are.

80
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,240
Just a second.

81
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,640
Here we go.

82
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
I'll keep the collaborative notes open.

83
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Hello, everybody. Good morning. Day three of the workshop today. We will take Git and version

84
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:27,200
control to the next level. My name is [Name] and what I like to do, I like to help

85
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,360
researchers with their coding and programming and computation. I come from computational

86
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:41,000
chemistry and these days spend time with code refinery, with high-performance computing,

87
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,600
and teaching. And I will be together with lots of people that you see or don't see.

88
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,320
I will take you through the lesson today, but my co-instructor today is [Name].

89
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,760
Good morning. My name is [Name]. I'm also part of the high performance computing group

90
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,720
here at UIT in Tromsø, Norway. And in my case, I have a background in computational

91
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,160
physics. So I was doing a postdoc here at UIT before I switched over to the HPC group.

92
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:18,640
So both [Name] and I can relate to the struggles and challenges that you as researchers might face

93
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,880
for anything coding related. Looking forward to this seminar.

94
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:32,480
And first of all, I took a lot of notes on my paper that I want to go through, some housekeeping.

95
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:40,520
So, on the bottom of the collaborative notes, you find the link to the lesson that we will

96
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,920
go through today.

97
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:49,520
And that's the page that is on the upper part of my screen.

98
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,680
And what I recommend you to do, if you had the tab open, maybe you were curious about

99
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,680
it yesterday, one thing I recommend you to do, reload the page.

100
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,600
So F5, reload it.

101
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,520
Make sure you get the fresh version.

102
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,860
We have been making changes to it until late night yesterday.

103
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,860
So it's like, it's like, you know, when you take a cake out of the oven, it's still warm.

104
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
It's amazing.

105
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,920
Hopefully, it's not undercooked, and hopefully, we don't get stomach ache.

106
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,540
But I think we have a really nice lesson for you.

107
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,560
We will have three exercise sessions.

108
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,360
they will all be even,

109
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,000
there will be longer exercise sessions

110
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,180
than the previous days.

111
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,560
I think we will need probably at least half an hour

112
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,900
for each exercise, maybe longer.

113
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,160
So today it will be really important

114
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,600
that you communicate back to us how it is going.

115
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,700
And we thought about all the possibilities

116
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,780
how people can participate.

117
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,540
So in groups or on your own.

118
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,180
So all of this will be possible.

119
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,640
Or expect chaos.

120
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,020
We expect chaos.

121
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,280
This is one of the most fun parts of the workshop

122
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,480
because we will all start in collaborating

123
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,580
a hundred people together, anything can happen.

124
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,600
So it will be chaotic.

125
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,440
This is what we expect.

126
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,680
This will be a lot of fun.

127
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,440
Once we start collaborating,

128
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,360
please remember code of conduct.

129
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,120
I mean, we are collaborating on a repository

130
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,940
that will be public.

131
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,200
Let's make sure that we are all comfortable.

132
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,940
let's not commit or send pull requests with any weird things.

133
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,420
So I wanted to say that.

134
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,620
Then I wanted to say that everything today

135
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,260
is possible to do on GitHub alone.

136
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,820
If you don't have any editor,

137
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,140
if your command line doesn't work,

138
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,060
if your authentication to GitHub doesn't really work,

139
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,740
it's not a problem, don't give up.

140
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,880
you can do all the exercises today on GitHub alone,

141
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
if you choose to.

142
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,340
We will build on the knowledge that we got

143
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,540
in day one and day two.

144
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,620
But even if you joined only today,

145
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,280
there will be links and you will have time to read up.

146
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,340
The exercises will need some time to set up.

147
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,260
We will give exercise leads time for that.

148
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,700
I will also show you some behind the scenes

149
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,700
of what we need to do to make this workshop,

150
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,540
to make these exercises possible for everybody.

151
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,340
So I will show you that in a moment.

152
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,940
And I will now go into these, the concepts.

153
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,020
Okay.

154
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,860
Before we go, so someone said that [Name]'s voice

155
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,620
was a little bit low.

156
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,800
Can you do another audio test?

157
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,880
Or [Name], can you say something?

158
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Or increase your volume?

159
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Am I still too low?

160
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
If I speak like this?

161
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,600
I can increase the input volume if that's necessary.

162
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,400
I guess it probably needs to be increased some.

163
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,600
Even if it gets metallic.

164
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,280
I hope it's better now.

165
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,680
Sounds good to my side.

166
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Not too metallic.

167
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,200
Sorry about that.

168
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I guess...

169
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Well, it's...

170
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Well, okay.

171
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:20,280
Okay, they say it's better and keep commenting if it needs to be adjusted more later.

172
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Okay.

173
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
Yeah.

174
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:27,240
So it's good that this was pointed out and sounds good, no problem at all.

175
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:34,920
I will now navigate into concepts and this is a connection to the previous days.

176
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:41,040
We will not go here through all the details again.

177
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,780
What we want to do today is use all the building blocks,

178
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,600
creating branches, creating commits,

179
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,040
creating pull requests and put them all together.

180
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,220
And now we will be able to collaborate.

181
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,080
We will really learn how to propose changes

182
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,360
to repositories of other people.

183
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,360
And we will be able to review changes

184
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,700
contributed by others.

185
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,700
And some concepts that we heard mentioned in the last days.

186
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,100
And here you can browse these read up,

187
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,220
like what is a repository?

188
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,060
What is a commit?

189
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,880
What is a branch?

190
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,720
What is a tag?

191
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,060
The one thing I want to show now here with [Name],

192
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,980
we have pictures on it,

193
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,380
like what is the difference between cloning and forking?

194
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,540
This is a question that came up a few times.

195
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:41,200
And I will scroll across the text and go straight to the pictures.

196
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,440
So those of you who will, who prefer to do the changes on your computer, in an editor

197
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:54,520
or on the command line, at some point, there will be a cloning step today.

198
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,120
And a clone creates a full copy.

199
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,520
And here we have this picture of a cloud because this repository is on a cloud service.

200
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,560
It's somewhere on the internet, and it contains branches and commits.

201
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,680
It contains also a tag.

202
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,200
And when you clone it, you copy everything.

203
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:27,000
And something that we have seen in one of the exercises yesterday, is that when we clone

204
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,480
All the branches are still there, but the branches get renamed.

205
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,240
So there is origin slash something, and origin is the place where we clone from.

206
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,320
It's a placeholder.

207
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,080
And it will typically create one local branch for us to work on, which is the default branch,

208
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,160
which will be the main branch.

209
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,100
So one thing that is missing here in this picture is that it will also create a local

210
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:02,980
branch called main from the default branch on the cloud service. So that is cloning.

211
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:09,420
And how does it differ from forking? Technically, it's very similar. So technically, clone and

212
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:15,580
fork are implemented in a very similar way. But if I scroll down here to the other picture,

213
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:21,900
a fork is also a copy. This is something we have done on Tuesday. And this is something

214
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:30,340
we will do today again. And that is making a full copy, but it stays in the on the internet.

215
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:41,180
And it it is a copy from somewhere to my own user space. And it could be from a place where

216
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:47,100
I cannot write cannot where I'm not allowed to create new commits to a place where I'm

217
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,500
allowed to make new commits.

218
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,300
This is often a starting point to make modifications

219
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,680
and it's a starting point for collaboration.

220
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,380
And in principle on my fork, I can do anything I like,

221
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,740
but I should always have a look at the license

222
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,580
because the license will tell me what are the things

223
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,340
that I'm allowed to do, expected to do.

224
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,460
But if the license allows me to do things,

225
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,380
I can do whatever I want on my fork.

226
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:28,300
I'm just here taking a pause because I see questions, which is awesome.

227
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,900
They are down here and I also see them on a different screen.

228
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,660
Does a commit does a fork inherit the commit history and branches of the so called upstream

229
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,200
repository as it does all the branches and all the commits.

230
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,520
But after I created the fork, it will not.

231
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,800
So if the left repository here then gets new commits and new branches, they don't automatically

232
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,200
go into my fork.

233
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:07,000
If I don't, if I create a fork and never touch it again, it will stay frozen in time.

234
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,640
And at the time when I copied it.

235
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,520
But today we will learn how do you update your fork and we will see that this used to

236
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
be more difficult.

237
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,680
It became two mouse clicks.

238
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,240
But we will practice that today.

239
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,200
We will see in an exercise how our fork gets out of date and we will learn how to update

240
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,800
it.

241
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:39,200
And one more mechanism that we will see today and we will use it to, we used it to create

242
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:47,360
exercise repositories. And the groups will use it to create their exercise repositories

243
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,920
is generating from a template. So you can take a git repository on the left side with

244
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:03,280
commits and branches. And you can make it a so called template. And from it, you can

245
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:11,440
generate new repositories. And if we stay in the cooking and baking analogy, it's like

246
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,240
a cookie cutter, like when you when you make, if you bake cookies, maybe you have like this

247
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:25,520
metallic cookie cutter, and you can then cut equally looking cookies with it. So then the

248
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,640
the cookie cutter will be my template

249
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,800
and I can generate repositories that look the same.

250
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,760
What happens when you generate a repository

251
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,120
is that all the history is flattened.

252
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,900
So it will flatten all the history into one commit.

253
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,960
So when you, when later, when we practice,

254
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,600
you will recognize that, oh, that's again,

255
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,320
with this repository book, sorry, the recipe book,

256
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,820
but there is only one commit

257
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,780
because all the history will get flattened into one commit.

258
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,900
But that's fine because this will be a starting point today

259
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,700
for us, and then we do all the collaboration

260
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,240
and the branches on top of that.

261
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,580
I will not talk about this part about importing.

262
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,100
So there are even more ways to get a repository,

263
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,340
to copy a repository,

264
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:29,660
But the point I want to make, and we will experience it.

265
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,340
So we can fork and we can clone.

266
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,680
But after we have done that, these repositories don't automatically talk to each other.

267
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,100
We need to actively tell them to.

268
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:47,860
And we do that either by pulling changes or by pushing changes.

269
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,900
And this, so then on the command line,

270
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,620
you will type git pull or git push.

271
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,940
And then if you work on VS code,

272
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,220
you will click on icon that says publish branch,

273
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,160
but under the hood, it will then push your branch.

274
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,500
So we need to actively synchronize changes.

275
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,540
And all the other operations that we do

276
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,660
when you work on a computer,

277
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,100
like creating commits, creating branches,

278
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:17,940
They are all local.

279
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,860
They don't need network.

280
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,440
Only push, pull,

281
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,160
and clone need travel over the network cable.

282
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,420
Okay, another look at the questions.

283
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,380
One question was about this flattening that I mentioned.

284
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,340
Is it the same thing like squashing?

285
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,260
Yeah, you could think of it.

286
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,080
So all the commits are squashed into one.

287
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,780
So technically it's the same thing.

288
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,660
So we don't need to really understand this today.

289
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,380
It's only that if you wonder why is,

290
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,060
why does the exercise only contain one single commit?

291
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,360
That's because we generate it from a template.

292
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,980
Did I forget anything important before we move on

293
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,620
and prepare you for the exercise?

294
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:22,120
Hopefully not.

295
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,500
So I will scroll up and go to the next episode.

296
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,420
And I want to prepare you for the exercise.

297
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:43,600
We will give you a lot of exercise time here, sorry here collaborating within the same repository.

298
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:49,360
Here is now we want to do collaboration.

299
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,600
There is some exercise preparation to be done.

300
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,720
And depending on whether you are a team or whether you are following on your own, different

301
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,600
steps are needed.

302
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,420
And we, you can do that in the exercise time.

303
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,380
So this will take a couple of minutes and that's okay.

304
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:18,220
So the first part of your exercise might be to really set up this exercise repository

305
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,740
and what your team leader will do.

306
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:30,740
And if you don't have one yet in your team, then designate one of you to be the team leader.

307
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:37,580
One of you will generate this exercise from the template.

308
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,360
And if you are following on your own, we have done that already for you.

309
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:47,340
But then we ask you to please tell us if you want to participate, because we need to add

310
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:55,260
you as a collaborator.

311
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,740
So here we need to be collaborators.

312
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,680
Once you get added as a collaborator, you will get an invitation from GitHub.

313
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,320
You need to accept it.

314
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:09,060
And then the other thing we recommend to do is once you get added to an exercise repository

315
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,140
is to unwatch it.

316
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:18,260
There is a screenshot here, but I want to show you how that looks.

317
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:25,020
So I will go into some of the, this will be the exercise that we will do with the stream

318
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:31,780
participants who are not part of a group.

319
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:35,540
And there is this button called watch and unwatch.

320
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,300
And here you will be able to select what kind of notifications do you want to get.

321
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,820
And by default, it might be that by default you have this one.

322
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:50,940
And then you get emails about all new issues and all new pull requests within the same

323
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,940
repository.

324
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,180
And maybe you don't want all these emails.

325
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,300
So what I do and what I recommend you to do is to switch to the participating and mentions.

326
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,620
It will only, you will only get up email updates about the issues that you have opened and

327
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,980
the pull request that you have opened,

328
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,420
or if somebody mentions you.

329
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,740
So this is what we mean by unwatching.

330
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,140
So there is this preparation time to be done,

331
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,940
but let me give you an overview

332
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,800
of what is part of this exercise.

333
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,620
And we have tried to make it clear

334
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:28,560
of what is possibly familiar,

335
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,500
like cloning a repository.

336
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,100
This is, we have done it before.

337
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,580
creating a branch we have done before,

338
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,820
committing a change to a new branch

339
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,980
and opening a pull request.

340
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,180
Now I know that not everybody maybe was here

341
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,220
and we don't expect that you remember everything.

342
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,580
So if you are unsure about this,

343
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,460
you can then always jump to the previous lesson

344
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,560
and have a look, how was that again?

345
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,060
How did I open a pull request?

346
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,780
And then we try to crystallize here.

347
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,880
What is the new thing?

348
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,540
What will be the new part in this exercise?

349
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,860
We will see what is a protected branch.

350
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,500
I will show you that in a second.

351
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,620
We will learn how to cross reference issues and pull requests.

352
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,220
And we will practice to review a pull request.

353
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,980
And even open draft pull requests.

354
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,420
So these will be the new things.

355
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:31,380
And for everything that is new, you will find screenshots and explanations below.

356
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,700
So use these hints, use these solutions.

357
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,020
And then here are the exercise tasks

358
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:42,920
that you can do with either within a group or on your own.

359
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,580
Okay, and I wanted to show you a little bit

360
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,020
about the behind the scenes

361
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,180
because one thing I need to do here

362
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,480
before everybody starts with this exercise.

363
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,480
And that you get an idea of what is,

364
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,320
I will look into this one,

365
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,520
centralized workflow exercise recorded.

366
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,000
So you don't have to do this.

367
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,300
I only want to show you what are the things

368
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,460
we need to prepare here.

369
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,600
There is a settings tab where I can control.

370
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:34,280
control. So now the team leaders will need to add collaborators. And the collaborator

371
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:41,240
in this case are the individual stream participants. And now I will change the role from read to

372
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:48,100
write. So from now on, actually, people can change the exercise. But please try to go

373
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:54,560
step by step. So I will change that to write permissions. The other thing I wanted to show

374
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:03,080
you is that we are using protected branches. And I do that up here branches. The main branch

375
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:14,440
is protected. What does it mean? Edit. It means that hopefully, unless I forgot something,

376
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:19,560
nobody can commit directly to the main branch or push directly to the main branch. And all

377
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:25,800
All changes to the main branch need to go through a pull request.

378
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,800
So that could be an interesting setting also for your exercise repository.

379
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,800
And I will do the same.

380
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:39,640
I need to give write permissions also on the unrecorded one.

381
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,440
Also here I will give you write permissions so that you can soon start with the exercise

382
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:56,520
settings collaborators and teams and now everybody can write to it.

383
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:02,600
So these kind of steps will be the beginning of the exercise hopefully it is all clear

384
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:10,360
here it's really important that you let us know how the exercise is going.

385
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,400
So during the exercise session, please give us feedback.

386
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,400
We need to give you, well, at least half an hour.

387
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,000
So I would say that we will do the exercise

388
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,440
until the full hour, at least.

389
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,720
We will then take a break.

390
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,500
We might need more exercise time later.

391
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,520
Here, let's collaborate.

392
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,520
The goal is open a branch, create a branch,

393
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,960
create commits, open a pull request,

394
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,500
and then review somebody else's pull request.

395
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,080
And let's practice to give this kind constructive feedback.

396
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,220
And then if you have time,

397
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,340
try to create a draft for request.

398
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,340
And below you find screenshots and also discussions,

399
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,620
how can that be useful and how to do these steps.

400
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,060
And I will practice here with the stream participants

401
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,940
and I will also practice with [Name].

402
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,740
So we will then, after the exercise, after the break,

403
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,900
we will look at some of these steps here on stream.

404
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,220
I'm checking my checklist,

405
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,220
but I forgot to say something essential.

406
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,700
Will we meet on Twitch before the break?

407
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,300
Yes, but just to hear the nice jingle

408
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,380
and just to remind everybody to really take a break,

409
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:34,500
to not let the exercise not consume the break.

410
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,500
So we'll be back, but only very briefly.

411
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:53,820
If yes, then let the exercises commence. Half an hour, but half an hour might not be enough.

412
00:50:53,820 --> 00:51:00,460
Don't worry, we will give you more time later. Let us know how it's going. And we will reconvene

413
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,220
on stream in half an hour for just to announce the break.

414
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,340
Good, let's try it out.

415
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,300
Let's see what happens.

416
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,460
I'm really excited about this.

417
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,420
See you in half an hour,

418
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,220
but see you on the notes before that, bye.

419
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,520
you

420
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,520

00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,520
you

429
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,520
you

430
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,520
you

431
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,520
you

432
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,520
you

433
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,520
you

434
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,520
you

435
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,520
you

436
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,520
you

437
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,520
you

438
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:02,520
you

439
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,520
you

440
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,520
you

441
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,520
you

442
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,520
you

443
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,520
you

444
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,520
you

445
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,520
you

446
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,520
you

447
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,520
you

448
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,520
you

449
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,520
you

450
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,520
you

451
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,520
you

452
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,520
you

453
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:32,520
you

454
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:02,520
you

455
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,520
you

456
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,520
you

457
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,520
you

458
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,520
you

459
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,520
you

460
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:02,520
you

461
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,520
you

462
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,520
you

463
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,520
you

464
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,520
you

465
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:32,520
you

466
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:02,520
you

467
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,520
you

468
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,520
you

469
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,520
you

470
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,520
you

471
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,520
you

472
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:02,520
you

473
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,520
you

474
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:02,520
you

475
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:32,520
you

476
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,520
you

477
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,520
you

478
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,520
you

479
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:42,580
And we are back from the exercise block.

480
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:45,300
And we know that not everybody finished, not a problem.

481
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,300
Let's first take a break.

482
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:50,140
We will take a 10 minute break, but then we will go through these steps together with

483
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,140
Gago.

484
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:55,180
And also in the second exercise, we stay in this repository.

485
01:21:55,180 --> 01:22:03,140
So don't worry about it. If, if you didn't finish so far, everybody take a break from

486
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:09,260
your screen and I will see you again in 10 minutes. See you then.

487
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,240
you

488
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,240
you

489
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,240
you

490
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:57,240
you

491
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,240
you

492
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,240
you

493
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:27,240
you

494
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,240
you

495
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,240
you

496
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,240
you

497
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:27,240
you

498
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:57,240
you

499
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,240
you

500
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:57,240
you

501
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:27,240
you

502
01:29:55,180 --> 01:29:57,240
you

503
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,240
you

504
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:57,240
you

505
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:52,460
Back from the break, after a nice jingle, welcome back everybody.

506
01:31:52,460 --> 01:32:03,020
So what I see here on top of my screen is, this was the exercise that with the stream

507
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:09,060
participants we can see that there is activity, there are many branches, lots of commits,

508
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:10,860
there are also some merges already.

509
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:17,180
So some of these changes have emerged, so that's very nice.

510
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:19,620
I can imagine that it was possibly not enough time

511
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:21,340
before the break.

512
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:26,540
And here I'm looking at the feedback from exercise.

513
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,900
It would be really helpful if you can indicate here

514
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:33,900
whether you are done or whether you are still in halfway.

515
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,740
So I'm not sure how representative it is,

516
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:40,980
but I'm looking at there.

517
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,740
This is in the notes.

518
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:55,740
So modan, is each of these O's, does it stand for like 10 people or 20 people?

519
01:32:55,740 --> 01:33:00,420
Or did really only five, six people indicate?

520
01:33:00,420 --> 01:33:07,380
It's not a problem if you got stuck, because we will, with [Name] here, we will demonstrate

521
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:10,580
the important steps.

522
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:16,740
And in the second exercise session, you will stay in the same exercise repository.

523
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:21,900
So it took a while to set up, but you can then either continue.

524
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:29,620
We will do a very similar thing, but we will focus more now on the review part and the

525
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:30,620
modifying part.

526
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:31,620
Thanks.

527
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:37,020
So now a few more people answered.

528
01:33:37,020 --> 01:33:43,380
So maybe it was okay time.

529
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:45,340
I suggest that let's have some fun now.

530
01:33:45,340 --> 01:33:47,840
You can all watch.

531
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:50,960
You will have enough time then in the next exercise

532
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:54,480
and [Name] and me will try this.

533
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:59,360
We will open an issue, open a pull request

534
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,520
and review it together.

535
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,880
[Name], how about you take the screen share from me

536
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,860
and you create a pull request.

537
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:11,620
And then I take it back and I will be the reviewer

538
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:14,840
and we will together review the changes.

539
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,800
Sounds good, yeah.

540
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,440
So we're moving now to the second lesson,

541
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:20,600
but as Radwan already mentioned,

542
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:23,320
it's a smooth transition since it's basically

543
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,000
the same thing, just that we will now focus

544
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,800
a little bit more on the reviews.

545
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,320
But I will just quickly go through the steps again

546
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,200
that we also did in the previous lesson.

547
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,120
So I'm now on the centralized workbox

548
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:34,520
as recorded repository,

549
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:37,640
and I will now start by creating an issue.

550
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,240
So I want to add a recipe,

551
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:46,240
So I say, add my tomato spaghetti recipe.

552
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:48,360
And why is it called issue?

553
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,720
Because it was, I think it was invented

554
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:53,360
to keep track of problems.

555
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,280
But here we don't use it to,

556
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,720
for a problem we use it to communicate an idea.

557
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:00,720
We communicate what we intend to do before we do it

558
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,160
because it gives us a chance to collect feedback.

559
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,840
Exactly, yeah.

560
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,400
One thing I can do here is to assign someone

561
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,360
for this issue.

562
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:14,440
And in this case, it's already assigned me automatically,

563
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:15,960
but in theory, I could assign anyone.

564
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,360
So I could also send another one if I would want.

565
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:23,240
I will just assign myself here.

566
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,200
And how do you also...

567
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,360
Can I just ask, how do you use this assigning in your work?

568
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:32,600
So I can tell that what I find sometimes useful

569
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,440
is that by assigning,

570
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,720
I communicate to other people that I'm working on it.

571
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:43,400
Yes, it's very helpful if you're working a team

572
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:45,000
where there's multiple people working on the project

573
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,360
and you want to indicate that you already decided

574
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:50,040
that you will work on this and have already thought

575
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:51,520
maybe about the problem,

576
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,880
so that other people don't duplicate this work,

577
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,540
so that they don't waste any time.

578
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,480
And sometimes, if you know that another person

579
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:02,760
is an expert in a certain part that you want to fix

580
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,560
of the code, for instance, then it might be a good idea

581
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:07,200
to assign this person as well as it.

582
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,240
maybe for the issue, but especially for a review,

583
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,700
that would be helpful.

584
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:13,280
I can do a similar thing with labels.

585
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,120
So I can say this is gonna be an enhancement,

586
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:19,320
but if it's like, if there's a mistake in the code,

587
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,400
if it's a bug, then I can indicate that here.

588
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,560
So this can also be very helpful for others.

589
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,840
In this case, I just choose the enhancement

590
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,400
and I will submit this now as an issue.

591
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:32,940
Oh, one question that we just got on the notes is,

592
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,800
do we always have to open an issue before we do a change?

593
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:40,840
you don't but it can be good practice but it's strictly speaking it's not

594
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:45,360
necessary and for smaller things it might be not necessary at all in my view

595
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:49,080
yeah so here we want to show you the technique it's more useful for bigger

596
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:54,440
changes so that when the big change is ready it doesn't come as a surprise to

597
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:59,000
everybody and also what you want to avoid is that after spending few weeks

598
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,720
developing something then you don't want to hear no thank you

599
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:08,880
this doesn't fit at all. What would have been nicer is that you first communicate what you

600
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:14,160
intend to do, you collect feedback, and then you code. So it's about avoiding surprises,

601
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:19,040
but for very small changes, not needed. Yeah, but that's a good point. You always

602
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,760
want to communicate before you spend a lot of time on the problem.

603
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:29,680
I will now create a pull request. So I will go back to my main branch. And it's already

604
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:33,280
showing me here that I already created a new branch. I will just quickly go to my new branch.

605
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:38,280
where I added the recipe that I mentioned in the issue.

606
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:44,420
And I now deliberately misspelled something.

607
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:48,820
So I misspelled the recipe the same way

608
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,340
as I, as a German native speaker,

609
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:52,380
would have done it in primary school.

610
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:56,020
But this is not the only problem in this new recipe.

611
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:59,580
There's also one major mistake in the ingredients

612
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:00,900
which would ruin the whole recipe.

613
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:03,780
So let's see whether that one will be able to spot it.

614
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:04,940
Yes.

615
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:07,980
So here we go a little bit step ahead

616
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:10,580
because we already show you

617
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:12,460
what people will do in the second exercise,

618
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,540
but that's great.

619
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:16,660
And in the commit message,

620
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:17,860
so the commit message here was

621
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:19,740
add tomato basil spaghetti recipe.

622
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:23,460
And in the commit message, you did not reference the issue.

623
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:24,300
It's not a problem.

624
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:25,940
So it can be done either,

625
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:28,300
it can be done in the commit message,

626
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:31,200
but it can also be done in the pull request,

627
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,200
which I think you plan to do.

628
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,400
Yes, I created this before I raised the issue,

629
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,880
so therefore that's possible.

630
01:38:37,880 --> 01:38:41,120
But I will now go back and it will already show me,

631
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,320
it will have this pop-up here where it's suggested

632
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,160
I could now compare the differences in the code

633
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,980
and create a pull request, so I will do this now.

634
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:52,240
I'll just quickly check, okay, I'm going from this branch,

635
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,760
from my new tomato spaghetti branch into the main branch,

636
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,400
that's what I want to do, I want to add this recipe.

637
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,880
And now I can assign a reviewer.

638
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,640
Let's say I choose [Name] in this case.

639
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:06,780
I can, again, I can choose some labels if I want.

640
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,120
In this case, I think enhancement makes the most sense.

641
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:17,120
And I could provide some more information if I wanted to,

642
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:21,680
but in this case, I think it's not strictly necessary.

643
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:24,400
If I scroll down, it will also show me the added file

644
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,220
or the differences.

645
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,360
In this case, I only add some lines.

646
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:27,440
I didn't delete any,

647
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,800
but otherwise that would be shown here as well.

648
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:31,880
And let's not forget to reference the issue number

649
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:32,720
before you open it.

650
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,200
Ah, yes, thank you.

651
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,760
So I can reference it here, fix.

652
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:39,100
Like there's a number of keywords I can use.

653
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,300
And we have them in the material.

654
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:48,200
So it's fix or fixes, close, closes, resolve, resolves.

655
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,640
Yeah, and it shows me now which issues

656
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:51,960
I could reference it to.

657
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:53,680
And I have here issue number 19.

658
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:55,680
So that was the one that I erased before.

659
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,000
So I will now create a pull request

660
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,280
and I will give the screen then to [Name]

661
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:03,720
and then we can discuss good practices for code reviews.

662
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:04,720
Yeah, so open it up.

663
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:07,100
Sorry, I forgot to mention one thing, sorry.

664
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,360
Okay, I just quickly mentioned this one thing.

665
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,040
It's good practice for when you create pull requests

666
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,940
to make it a lot easier for a reviewer as well

667
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:20,160
to try to have short chunks of code

668
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,920
that you want to be reviewed

669
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:25,800
since the attention of the reviewer is limited

670
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,920
And maybe for some complicated bugs that you want to fix,

671
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:32,140
it is necessary to have several hundreds of lines of code.

672
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:34,540
But if possible, always keep it short

673
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:37,060
because you want to, and you can also add

674
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:40,660
some additional comments if you want here

675
01:40:40,660 --> 01:40:43,780
to some of the lines of your pull request

676
01:40:43,780 --> 01:40:46,820
if you want to communicate even more information

677
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:47,820
than there is already.

678
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,940
So this can be always a good idea

679
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:52,420
because since we don't speak person to person

680
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:54,860
or face to face to another person, to the reviewer,

681
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:56,820
Sometimes if you work with someone in a different time zone

682
01:40:56,820 --> 01:40:59,820
or in a different university,

683
01:40:59,820 --> 01:41:01,500
it's always good to over communicate

684
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,180
and not provide too little information.

685
01:41:05,180 --> 01:41:06,420
But I will now create this pull request.

686
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:08,220
Sorry about the one, and I'll give the word to you.

687
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:09,100
Oh no, nothing to apologize.

688
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:09,920
This was great.

689
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,140
We have enough time and it's really good

690
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,020
that we do that here step-by-step.

691
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:16,220
Okay, keep the screen.

692
01:41:16,220 --> 01:41:19,340
I will now take it from you in a second.

693
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:22,100
And then we do the reviewing together.

694
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:29,860
Good, now I first need to find your pull request.

695
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:35,580
So I go in pull requests and now I will review,

696
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,040
this is yours.

697
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:41,000
So each pull request and each issue has a number

698
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,120
and your pull request is the number 21

699
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,840
and I will now review it.

700
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,740
So let's discuss what are the things that we should look at

701
01:41:54,740 --> 01:41:56,540
and how do you review a pull request?

702
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:02,700
I have been assigned, so okay,

703
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:05,100
go request it for me, so that will also,

704
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,140
somewhere I got an email about it.

705
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,340
So if I was somewhere else, I at least know.

706
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:12,280
And then the thing that I look at,

707
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:15,320
oh, this is about tomato basil spaghetti.

708
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,300
First thing I look at is the title.

709
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:22,980
I might also look at which branch is it going to,

710
01:42:22,980 --> 01:42:25,140
typically the default branch, it's going to main.

711
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:26,240
This is the goal here.

712
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:35,260
And the next thing I would look at this file changed.

713
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:38,360
Is this also what you do Gecko anomaly?

714
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:41,540
Yes, I spend most of the time on the files changed.

715
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:43,940
So let's look at what is in there, files changed.

716
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,740
I would now browse it.

717
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:51,900
I mean, overall, it looks pretty okay.

718
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:56,660
There are some problems.

719
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:59,340
One problem is up here.

720
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:04,700
And I could ask Ego to fix that, so the spelling.

721
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:07,340
I will show you that there is actually a better way.

722
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:10,340
And that will be part of your second exercise.

723
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:13,300
So let's come back to that in a moment.

724
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,340
There is also another problem.

725
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:19,580
Can somebody spot it?

726
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:22,860
It looks like it has an unhealthy amount of salt here.

727
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:25,580
So this will,

728
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,420
this is something I'm,

729
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,420
so how do I get feedback?

730
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:34,500
Well, one way to give feedback,

731
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,060
if you go back to conversation,

732
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:39,660
we can have a discussion here,

733
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:41,100
so I could give feedback here.

734
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:45,020
And it's nice to be kind, thanks so much.

735
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:49,400
Really nice recipe.

736
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:51,600
But how about that salt amount?

737
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:58,480
The salt amount, shouldn't we reduce it?

738
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:07,820
And now if I comment, it's here, it's recorded.

739
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:11,380
So we have a context here, we have a discussion thread.

740
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:17,860
If I need to, and now we, us two are part of this discussion

741
01:44:17,860 --> 01:44:22,620
Sometimes I need to involve an expert, so I don't know,

742
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:24,420
but I can ask somebody else for an opinion.

743
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:25,460
You can then mention people.

744
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:27,380
I will now not mention somebody else,

745
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:29,860
but let's imagine you want to ask me for,

746
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,340
somebody wants to ask me for an opinion.

747
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:34,780
You could mention, what do you think?

748
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,940
So if you start this ad,

749
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:44,580
and if this doesn't make more sense

750
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:45,740
because I'm asking myself,

751
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:48,620
but then I will get an email

752
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:53,300
and you can involve other people into a conversation

753
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:54,600
if you need their opinion.

754
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:56,820
So I'll remove that.

755
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,980
So that's one way to comment.

756
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:02,380
The other way that might be maybe more useful

757
01:45:02,380 --> 01:45:04,740
is to, if I go back to fast changed,

758
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:08,220
you can comment directly here.

759
01:45:08,220 --> 01:45:11,260
For instance, I can say here that by clicking on the plus,

760
01:45:11,260 --> 01:45:12,720
I can give a leave a comment.

761
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:22,520
Not sure about the salt amount, add a single comment.

762
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:31,760
And but on the other hand, Parmesan cheese, nice.

763
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:37,760
I really like this, add a single comment.

764
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:40,260
Because then, when I go back to the conversation,

765
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:47,320
it's the submitter will see what line am I referring to.

766
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,920
They don't have to guess.

767
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:53,420
Imagine there are 10,000 lines.

768
01:45:56,120 --> 01:45:58,520
And here I refer to this line.

769
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,200
You can even refer to entire code blocks.

770
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:03,680
So this can be useful.

771
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,480
And there is, you can even go a step further.

772
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:15,120
Because I could add a comment here that spelling is not correct. Can you please fix that? But

773
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:24,680
I know how to fix this. There is this plus minus symbol here, add a suggestion. So I

774
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:32,000
can add an actual suggestion. So if I click on the plus minus, I can edit the code directly.

775
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,000
So it should be tomato, basil, spaghetti.

776
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,400
Hopefully that's correct.

777
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:46,320
And if I now add a single comment with a suggestion,

778
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:49,080
which can be on one line or it can be on multiple lines.

779
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,720
Well, let's see how that will look

780
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:53,520
when we go back to the conversation.

781
01:46:53,520 --> 01:47:04,560
When we go back to the conversation, there is a suggestion for a change.

782
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:13,400
And now [Name] doesn't have to do anything except accept it or not.

783
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:19,280
And I mean, I will not give the screen back to [Name], but formally, it should not be

784
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:31,920
me committing my own suggestions. But now, if Gago reads this, can accept this by zoom

785
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:40,080
out here by clicking. Why is this not in my screen? And guess what this is? This is a

786
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:45,080
commit message, fix spelling mistake.

787
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,380
So we can do all of this without going back to my editor,

788
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:55,160
going back to my command line, commit.

789
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,800
And now this has been fixed here, there's a new commit.

790
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:05,620
And now if I look at the files changed,

791
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,400
there is no spelling mistake anymore.

792
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:17,080
And what would now, but now I'm a little bit too lazy to fix the two kilo salt, I don't know how much it should be.

793
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:26,080
I leave it to Gecko. What would be the mechanism now for Gecko to make an improvement to the pull request?

794
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:30,080
Some people, what they do is that if they see that, oh, there's something wrong,

795
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,080
what they will do is that they will close the pull request and open a new one.

796
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:41,080
But that's not very good because that will fragment discussions and it will fragment the context

797
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:44,080
because then it will be a new pull request and we will

798
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:49,080
then we need to remember that we had also the pull request 21.

799
01:48:49,080 --> 01:48:53,080
So a much nicer mechanism to

800
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:57,080
to improve pull requests, and you will practice that

801
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:59,080
in your second exercise

802
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,080
is to

803
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:06,200
recognize that pull requests, they are always from a branch

804
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:14,120
towards another branch. And if you want to make changes to a pull request, all you need to do

805
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:23,320
is to add new commits to the source branch. So if [Name] adds new commits to the branch,

806
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:29,640
they will get added to the pull request. And this is the way to modify a pull request until

807
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,720
until we are all happy here.

808
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,720
And once we are happy,

809
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,220
we have resolved all the conversations,

810
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,320
then we will merge it.

811
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,180
And this is what we will practice.

812
01:49:40,180 --> 01:49:41,280
So in the second part,

813
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:44,880
and let me go to the second part here.

814
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,840
It's very similar.

815
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,960
We are still in the same exercise repository.

816
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,840
You don't need to set up anything new.

817
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:57,780
The new thing now is we will focus more on the reviewing.

818
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:05,800
and you will you will practice the things that feature showed you and what you can try to do is

819
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:12,040
maybe try to open a new pull request where you

820
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:20,280
maybe there's a typo that is easy to fix and there is also a larger mistake and then

821
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:25,160
then look at other people's pull requests in the same exercise

822
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:31,160
try to make suggestions to their pull requests, try to do what I did with this typo fix,

823
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:38,760
and then learn how to make amendments to your pull requests by adding new commits to it.

824
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:46,840
We can maybe give some general advice for how to do reviews. One thing is spend time on things

825
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:52,760
that humans are good at, by which I mean don't spend time at things which you can automate.

826
01:50:52,760 --> 01:51:02,720
For instance, if one typical thing which is very often done by so-called linters or code

827
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:05,080
formatters is things like code formatting.

828
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:08,920
If you say, okay, you don't like the bracket here, you would want to split this into two

829
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:10,800
lines and stuff like this.

830
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,920
This is not something which we should focus on during the code review because we have

831
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,360
automation tools for that.

832
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:22,200
However, what we should try to do together is to get the code which is there to an acceptable

833
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:27,880
stage and then get it merged as soon as possible so that a lot of people profit from it.

834
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,320
It's really not the case that the reviewer is there to show how smart the reviewer is

835
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:37,600
or to show how he or she would have implemented or they would have implemented stuff.

836
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,560
It's really kind of a collaborative effort.

837
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:44,680
And in this case, it was me as kind of the new kind of employee in the group, the new

838
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:48,880
member of the group who now creates the pull requests and then the senior person, the very

839
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:51,600
experienced person, the other one who did the review.

840
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:54,400
But there is no reason why it couldn't be the other way around.

841
01:51:54,400 --> 01:52:00,200
Because the purpose of a pull request is not just getting the code to an acceptable stage,

842
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:04,680
but also to transfer knowledge.

843
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:08,640
So in my experience, one is learning a lot from reading code from other people and the

844
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:12,600
pull requests are a wonderful opportunity for that.

845
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:19,120
And also, maybe one last comment, another one is a very experienced developer might

846
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:22,720
understand whatever gets submitted quite quickly.

847
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:26,000
But one quality of code or like one side of a good

848
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,960
code is also readability and how easy it is to understand for

849
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:35,440
someone who is not an expert in whatever the proper language might be.

850
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:38,720
So also the perspective of someone who is new to the team can be very valuable

851
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:41,920
to improve the code itself.

852
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:46,640
These were such great points. So is this really a diversity that makes codes

853
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:53,960
better great points that it's about learning it's about the reviewer doesn't have to be

854
01:52:53,960 --> 01:53:02,840
the senior person it can be the the new colleague in your in your team this was really such

855
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:10,640
great points and also try to so it's like try to like it's code review but that doesn't

856
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:14,640
mean that you are not allowed to give any positive comments or like say to point out

857
01:53:14,640 --> 01:53:18,480
things that you like. I mean, there's nothing worse for someone who spent weeks on fixing a

858
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:22,400
very difficult bug, submitting the pull request, and then the only suggestions he gets are like

859
01:53:25,440 --> 01:53:31,600
some tiny comments about some semantics, which really don't kind of have a large impact on the

860
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:38,080
overall code. And then the pull request doesn't get accepted that way. So I mean,

861
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:42,080
for the person who spent a large amount of time on fixing this bug, this can be really discouraging.

862
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:47,520
So I think it's really important to communicate things well and also to focus on the positive

863
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:48,520
things as well.

864
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:54,880
Because, I mean, as always in the internet, it's easy to kind of point out or like to

865
01:53:54,880 --> 01:54:00,280
communicate things in a natural way that you would never communicate face-to-face.

866
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:05,360
And for somebody who joined the project or just imagine how you would feel if it's your

867
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:07,800
first pull request to a project.

868
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,240
it's so important, your first experience

869
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:13,160
on how they respond to you.

870
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:15,080
And if the response is very negative

871
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:16,560
and if the experience is negative,

872
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,120
I mean, you will never come back to the project again.

873
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:21,660
So especially this first contact is so important.

874
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:25,280
And then it's not so, the code doesn't have to be perfect,

875
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,640
but to really bring them into the project

876
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,240
and give them a good experience.

877
01:54:32,460 --> 01:54:33,420
So let's practice that.

878
01:54:33,420 --> 01:54:34,880
Let's practice the technique.

879
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,880
in this exercise and what we will do,

880
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:43,320
we will give you 25 minutes.

881
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,680
We're basically until the hour

882
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,960
and then we can take a long one hour break

883
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:55,000
and here focus on suggesting changes,

884
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,560
how to apply changes, what we just showed you.

885
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,440
And we try to summarize this in this,

886
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:04,440
so the tasks are very similar.

887
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:10,000
We try to hear this still again, what are the new things in this exercise?

888
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,920
And you stay in this centralized exercise repository.

889
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:25,120
It's only later after the longer break where we will move to a different repository.

890
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:31,200
Just looking here at notes, whether anything unclear there.

891
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:33,720
I saw a good question.

892
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:40,400
It was something about, is this what we do for every project or something like that?

893
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,640
And I think it's worth mentioning.

894
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:48,360
So day two, so most projects would be somewhere between day two and day three.

895
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:53,800
So day two was simple, you push directly, you don't worry too much.

896
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:59,840
Day three, we're going through the really formal process of collaborating on something

897
01:55:59,840 --> 01:56:01,360
bigger.

898
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:09,660
So not every project is day three, maybe not many projects are day two, many are probably

899
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,140
in between there.

900
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:12,140
Yes.

901
01:56:12,140 --> 01:56:17,260
So here we can imagine, this is a project for, you can imagine we are three people,

902
01:56:17,260 --> 01:56:19,660
four people in a research group.

903
01:56:19,660 --> 01:56:27,000
One person is the principal investigator, but it's not the person who will review everything.

904
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,160
we agree that we all help out with reviewing.

905
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:31,940
Nobody, everybody is, nobody is more equal.

906
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:34,800
So the model that we are trying right now

907
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:37,280
could be a good fit for that scenario.

908
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:42,280
Three to, three to 20 people, or three to 50 people.

909
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,040
Once it gets much bigger,

910
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,920
maybe we want to do the thing that we will do

911
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,200
after the longer break.

912
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:51,800
Good.

913
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,840
Thanks a lot for pasting.

914
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:00,320
we will then be, the exercise will be until the full hour.

915
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,720
So until zero, zero, but then there will be a,

916
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,160
should we then announce the break?

917
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:07,200
Yes, we will announce the break,

918
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,840
just that people don't forget it.

919
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,660
So we'll be back in 25 minutes for the jingle,

920
01:57:12,660 --> 01:57:15,360
and then we will announce on one hour break afterwards.

921
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:17,820
Good luck, everybody.

922
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:19,360
We will also help here,

923
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:23,520
all the co-organizers and co-instructors will help

924
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:28,520
with the reviewing for the requests in this,

925
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,000
for the individual stream participants.

926
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:34,080
Have fun.

927
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,420
Let's all, let's suggest and improve

928
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:37,960
and let's be really positive.

929
01:57:37,960 --> 01:57:38,800
See you later.

930
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:41,100
Bye.

931
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:58,520

you

982
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:39,600
Welcome back from exercise everybody.

983
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,920
And the little jingle was reminding us that we should take a long one hour break.

984
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:47,040
So step away from the monitor.

985
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:50,880
we will be back on stream in one hour.

986
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:53,020
And I realized I don't share the screen.

987
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,320
Whoops.

988
02:21:58,520 --> 02:21:59,360
Here.

989
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,240
We'll be back in one hour.

990
02:22:02,240 --> 02:22:05,160
And it's so nice to see all this activity

991
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,300
that happened in the meantime.

992
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:08,720
We will discuss it then when we are back

993
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:11,620
and we will then introduce some more really fun things

994
02:22:11,620 --> 02:22:15,720
that are possible with code review and pull requests.

995
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:16,920
See you all in one hour.

996
02:22:17,040 --> 02:22:22,780
Bye, and I need to click on the right thing here.

997
02:22:22,780 --> 02:22:23,220
See you then.

998
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,100

999
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:19,100

02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:19,100
you

1064
02:55:47,040 --> 02:55:49,100
you

1065
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:19,100
you

1066
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:49,100
you

1067
02:57:17,040 --> 02:57:19,100
you

1068
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:49,100
you

1069
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,100
you

1070
02:58:47,040 --> 02:58:49,100
you

1071
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:19,100
you

1072
02:59:47,040 --> 02:59:49,100
you

1073
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,100
you

1074
03:00:47,040 --> 03:00:49,100
you

1075
03:01:17,040 --> 03:01:19,100
you

1076
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:49,100
you

1077
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:19,100
you

1078
03:02:47,040 --> 03:02:49,100
you

1079
03:03:17,040 --> 03:03:19,100
you

1080
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:49,100
you

1081
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:19,100
you

1082
03:04:47,040 --> 03:04:49,100
you

1083
03:05:17,040 --> 03:05:19,100
you

1084
03:05:47,040 --> 03:05:49,100
you

1085
03:06:17,040 --> 03:06:19,100
you

1086
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:49,100
you

1087
03:07:17,040 --> 03:07:19,100
you

1088
03:07:47,040 --> 03:07:49,100
you

1089
03:08:17,040 --> 03:08:19,100
you

1090
03:08:47,040 --> 03:08:49,100
you

1091
03:09:17,040 --> 03:09:19,100
you

1092
03:09:47,040 --> 03:09:49,100
you

1093
03:10:17,040 --> 03:10:19,100
you

1094
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:49,100
you

1095
03:11:17,040 --> 03:11:19,100
you

1096
03:11:47,040 --> 03:11:49,100
you

1097
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:19,100
you

1098
03:12:47,040 --> 03:12:49,100
you

1099
03:13:17,040 --> 03:13:19,100
you

1100
03:13:47,040 --> 03:13:49,100
you

1101
03:14:17,040 --> 03:14:19,100
you

1102
03:14:47,040 --> 03:14:49,100
you

1103
03:15:17,040 --> 03:15:19,100
you

1104
03:15:47,040 --> 03:15:49,100
you

1105
03:16:17,040 --> 03:16:19,100
you

1106
03:16:47,040 --> 03:16:49,100
you

1107
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:19,100
you

1108
03:17:47,040 --> 03:17:49,100
you

1109
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:19,100
you

1110
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:49,100
you

1111
03:19:17,040 --> 03:19:19,100
you

1112
03:19:47,040 --> 03:19:49,100
you

1113
03:20:17,040 --> 03:20:19,100
you

1114
03:20:47,040 --> 03:20:49,100
you

1115
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:46,280
Welcome back.

1116
03:21:46,280 --> 03:21:51,280
We are back from a longer break, back on stream.

1117
03:21:53,540 --> 03:21:55,280
I hope the exercise went well.

1118
03:21:56,540 --> 03:22:00,780
I'm really happy here with the progress we've done

1119
03:22:00,780 --> 03:22:02,500
on our exercise repositories.

1120
03:22:05,140 --> 03:22:10,020
We will now move on to the third episode of today.

1121
03:22:12,440 --> 03:22:13,580
And I also wanted to say something

1122
03:22:13,580 --> 03:22:15,500
about these exercise repositories.

1123
03:22:16,280 --> 03:22:21,160
Because in the third episode, we will use a different one.

1124
03:22:21,160 --> 03:22:25,680
And you don't have to be worried that your recipe suggestions stay here forever.

1125
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:30,180
We will keep these exercise repositories for one more week.

1126
03:22:30,180 --> 03:22:31,680
But after the workshop, we will delete them.

1127
03:22:31,680 --> 03:22:33,680
So everything we did here will be gone.

1128
03:22:33,680 --> 03:22:38,680
You don't have to worry about that.

1129
03:22:38,680 --> 03:22:43,720
Also I learned that today is the Pi Day, March 14.

1130
03:22:43,720 --> 03:22:51,200
Hopefully this has influenced some of the recipe choices.

1131
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:55,520
For the third episode, we will use a different exercise repository.

1132
03:22:55,520 --> 03:23:03,360
We will now practice a forking workflow.

1133
03:23:03,360 --> 03:23:05,880
So I will already navigate to it.

1134
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:10,120
You will set it up in your exercise session later.

1135
03:23:10,120 --> 03:23:16,920
There will be less to set up because this time you will not have to add any collaborators,

1136
03:23:16,920 --> 03:23:20,840
you don't have to communicate your GitHub accounts.

1137
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:28,840
The whole point of the next exercise is that we learn how to modify somebody else's repository.

1138
03:23:28,840 --> 03:23:33,040
And somebody else's repository could, for instance, be all the Code Refinery lessons,

1139
03:23:33,040 --> 03:23:34,480
which are all repositories.

1140
03:23:34,480 --> 03:23:38,840
So now you know, you will learn how to suggest changes

1141
03:23:38,840 --> 03:23:40,040
to the lesson.

1142
03:23:40,040 --> 03:23:42,080
And some of you have already done that.

1143
03:23:42,080 --> 03:23:43,360
So thanks so much for that.

1144
03:23:43,360 --> 03:23:45,560
We didn't have yet time to review everything.

1145
03:23:47,220 --> 03:23:51,160
So I will now navigate to the episode called,

1146
03:23:52,560 --> 03:23:54,520
oh, this one, that belong to others.

1147
03:23:56,200 --> 03:23:57,960
How to contribute changes to repositories

1148
03:23:57,960 --> 03:23:59,160
that belong to others.

1149
03:23:59,160 --> 03:24:06,120
So there's a little bit of setup, but it will be easier.

1150
03:24:06,120 --> 03:24:11,960
Make sure that you don't stay in the same exercise repository as from earlier today.

1151
03:24:11,960 --> 03:24:14,400
Can someone add the link to the notes?

1152
03:24:14,400 --> 03:24:16,160
My hands are a bit full here.

1153
03:24:16,160 --> 03:24:19,800
Oh yeah, the cat is there.

1154
03:24:19,800 --> 03:24:21,680
Okay, so everybody focus on the cat.

1155
03:24:21,680 --> 03:24:22,880
I will paste.

1156
03:24:22,880 --> 03:24:26,400
We are now here.

1157
03:24:26,400 --> 03:24:29,480
We are here, and this is maybe not in the nicest format,

1158
03:24:31,520 --> 03:24:33,220
but at the bottom of the document,

1159
03:24:36,080 --> 03:24:37,080
this is where we are.

1160
03:24:40,600 --> 03:24:45,300
And a lot in the next exercise will be familiar.

1161
03:24:46,600 --> 03:24:49,000
Again, a new branch, again, a pull request.

1162
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:53,640
This time, the pull request goes to a different repository,

1163
03:24:53,640 --> 03:24:54,900
not the same repository.

1164
03:24:56,400 --> 03:24:59,240
you don't have to add collaborators,

1165
03:24:59,240 --> 03:25:03,160
you don't have write permissions in the exercise repository

1166
03:25:04,760 --> 03:25:06,680
and you can still suggest changes.

1167
03:25:06,680 --> 03:25:07,680
That is really cool.

1168
03:25:08,920 --> 03:25:11,640
And there will be a few things that are new.

1169
03:25:11,640 --> 03:25:15,640
So every time we try to sneak in some fun new aspects

1170
03:25:18,640 --> 03:25:23,640
and one will be automated testing.

1171
03:25:23,640 --> 03:25:27,120
testing, we will show that in a minute with [Name].

1172
03:25:28,480 --> 03:25:30,280
And then we will also show you that

1173
03:25:32,280 --> 03:25:36,480
after the changes are merged, you will see that your fork.

1174
03:25:38,160 --> 03:25:39,320
So when you start the exercise,

1175
03:25:39,320 --> 03:25:41,480
you will fork the exercise repository.

1176
03:25:41,480 --> 03:25:44,560
You will see that at some point the fork is out of date

1177
03:25:44,560 --> 03:25:46,460
and we will practice how to update it.

1178
03:25:48,400 --> 03:25:50,640
And then at the bottom of the page, there is,

1179
03:25:50,640 --> 03:25:53,320
There are some thoughts about how to approach

1180
03:25:53,320 --> 03:25:56,240
other people's repositories with ideas, changes, requests.

1181
03:25:58,400 --> 03:26:00,600
And then hopefully we managed to have

1182
03:26:00,600 --> 03:26:03,640
for the last 20 minutes, 30 minutes of discussion session

1183
03:26:03,640 --> 03:26:07,360
where all of you can ask us about Git and GitHub

1184
03:26:07,360 --> 03:26:08,840
and best practices.

1185
03:26:12,560 --> 03:26:14,800
So that's the plan, but we will first start.

1186
03:26:14,800 --> 03:26:15,960
So you can first just watch.

1187
03:26:15,960 --> 03:26:20,960
we will show you the two key steps in the next exercise.

1188
03:26:22,400 --> 03:26:23,480
And for this,

1189
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:28,480
Gago and me will go into this forking workflow

1190
03:26:30,840 --> 03:26:32,140
exercise recorded.

1191
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:37,000
And the first exercise step will be to create a fork from it

1192
03:26:38,840 --> 03:26:40,140
to create your own copy.

1193
03:26:42,040 --> 03:26:44,120
Should I give the screen to you, [Name]?

1194
03:26:45,960 --> 03:26:48,960
Okay.

1195
03:26:54,200 --> 03:26:58,680
So as another one mentioned we are now on the forking workflow exercises or

1196
03:26:58,680 --> 03:27:05,400
exercise recorded repository and I've already created an issue. Again it's

1197
03:27:05,400 --> 03:27:13,640
pretty much the same as before. I'm just going to add the recipe again and I'm

1198
03:27:13,640 --> 03:27:18,440
to create a fork, which you do by clicking on this button. So I've done that just now,

1199
03:27:18,440 --> 03:27:22,280
a few minutes ago. So I now went to the four seconds.

1200
03:27:23,160 --> 03:27:26,520
So you have now, you are now in your copy. Yes.

1201
03:27:26,520 --> 03:27:33,160
Something that will, some people will ask about this. Where are, where are the issues here?

1202
03:27:33,160 --> 03:27:37,400
Because now I don't see them here. And we need to remember that issues typically stay on

1203
03:27:37,400 --> 03:27:41,680
on the central, the upstream repository.

1204
03:27:41,680 --> 03:27:45,320
So when you created the fork, you copied everything,

1205
03:27:45,320 --> 03:27:46,400
but you didn't copy the issues.

1206
03:27:46,400 --> 03:27:49,960
And up there, there is no issue tab.

1207
03:27:49,960 --> 03:27:52,200
One could enable it, but it is customary

1208
03:27:52,200 --> 03:27:55,440
to track all issues and ideas and problems

1209
03:27:55,440 --> 03:27:56,700
in one central place.

1210
03:27:58,320 --> 03:27:59,200
Good.

1211
03:27:59,200 --> 03:28:00,300
Yeah, very good point.

1212
03:28:01,480 --> 03:28:04,220
But we will see afterwards how to link pull requests

1213
03:28:04,220 --> 03:28:07,320
to issues in the original repository.

1214
03:28:07,320 --> 03:28:10,280
So I'll now create a new branch,

1215
03:28:11,880 --> 03:28:12,920
which I've already done as well,

1216
03:28:12,920 --> 03:28:15,800
and I just copied the same recipe

1217
03:28:16,720 --> 03:28:18,760
from before into this branch.

1218
03:28:18,760 --> 03:28:21,900
So it's the same as before, with the corrected title.

1219
03:28:22,740 --> 03:28:26,540
So the two issues that [Name] has pointed out

1220
03:28:26,540 --> 03:28:29,800
in the last review, they are not an issue here,

1221
03:28:29,800 --> 03:28:32,100
but we will see whether there's anything else.

1222
03:28:34,120 --> 03:28:37,300
So I now go back to the repository,

1223
03:28:37,300 --> 03:28:39,500
and I create a pull request.

1224
03:28:39,500 --> 03:28:41,580
So I can see here, there's this pop-up,

1225
03:28:41,580 --> 03:28:44,060
it shows me this branch is one commit ahead

1226
03:28:44,060 --> 03:28:46,460
of the original branch.

1227
03:28:47,600 --> 03:28:48,900
And I can now create a pull request

1228
03:28:48,900 --> 03:28:50,220
by clicking on contribute.

1229
03:28:51,380 --> 03:28:53,380
Then it suggests open a pull request.

1230
03:28:57,900 --> 03:28:59,140
So I can double check now again,

1231
03:28:59,140 --> 03:29:01,420
whether I'm creating this pull request

1232
03:29:01,420 --> 03:29:02,580
between the right branches.

1233
03:29:02,580 --> 03:29:04,380
So I'm here on my local fork.

1234
03:29:04,380 --> 03:29:09,380
And the branch that I'm using here is a feature branch.

1235
03:29:09,740 --> 03:29:12,660
So the one that I just created now,

1236
03:29:12,660 --> 03:29:16,540
and I want to merge this code into the main branch

1237
03:29:16,540 --> 03:29:17,860
of the original repository.

1238
03:29:17,860 --> 03:29:19,060
So I see that's correct.

1239
03:29:20,420 --> 03:29:21,780
I can add a title.

1240
03:29:24,860 --> 03:29:26,700
In this case, it takes the last commit message.

1241
03:29:26,700 --> 03:29:27,900
And this time in the commit message,

1242
03:29:27,900 --> 03:29:31,620
I've already referenced that this code

1243
03:29:31,620 --> 03:29:34,460
is supposed to be fixing an issue.

1244
03:29:34,460 --> 03:29:36,500
So in this case, I've wrote fix hashtag one,

1245
03:29:36,500 --> 03:29:39,500
because the issue that I'm trying to fix

1246
03:29:39,500 --> 03:29:43,120
is the first one that has been created to this repository.

1247
03:29:43,120 --> 03:29:46,140
Also, if I would write it here, just to quickly show it,

1248
03:29:46,140 --> 03:29:49,220
it will now show me all the issues

1249
03:29:49,220 --> 03:29:51,380
that are listed there in the original repository,

1250
03:29:51,380 --> 03:29:52,700
and I could choose this one again,

1251
03:29:52,700 --> 03:29:54,140
but I've already done it here in the title,

1252
03:29:54,140 --> 03:29:56,420
so I don't need to do that here again.

1253
03:29:56,420 --> 03:29:58,860
But it shows me here with all the issues,

1254
03:29:58,860 --> 03:30:00,700
or it would show me here all the issues

1255
03:30:00,700 --> 03:30:03,340
that are existing for, that are open at the moment

1256
03:30:03,340 --> 03:30:05,260
in this original repository.

1257
03:30:05,260 --> 03:30:06,660
Now it's the same thing as last time.

1258
03:30:06,660 --> 03:30:09,020
I can again choose [Name] as a reviewer.

1259
03:30:09,020 --> 03:30:12,900
If I want to specify someone, I can add a label if I want.

1260
03:30:14,700 --> 03:30:19,260
And then we create, we click on create pull request.

1261
03:30:19,260 --> 03:30:21,660
And we will now see how this automated tests

1262
03:30:22,660 --> 03:30:24,740
can be extremely helpful.

1263
03:30:24,740 --> 03:30:27,420
So [Name], should I give the screen back to you

1264
03:30:27,420 --> 03:30:32,420
or should I quickly point out what is happening here?

1265
03:30:32,660 --> 03:30:35,140
Yeah, you can explain that and then it will go,

1266
03:30:35,140 --> 03:30:38,780
then I will take it over and merge it on my side.

1267
03:30:39,980 --> 03:30:41,880
Yeah, so now something interesting happens.

1268
03:30:41,880 --> 03:30:42,900
In this repository,

1269
03:30:42,900 --> 03:30:45,880
we added some so-called GitHub workflows,

1270
03:30:45,880 --> 03:30:49,100
which is a way of implementing automated tests

1271
03:30:49,100 --> 03:30:50,980
or automated checks for every code

1272
03:30:50,980 --> 03:30:53,300
that is submitted in a pull request.

1273
03:30:53,300 --> 03:30:55,220
Okay, click here on details.

1274
03:30:55,220 --> 03:31:01,420
We'll show you afterwards how this is set up and then I get here all the steps

1275
03:31:01,420 --> 03:31:06,420
that are done in this test and it shows me here that one test is failing so in

1276
03:31:06,420 --> 03:31:09,540
this case there's only one test that is done otherwise there would be multiple

1277
03:31:09,540 --> 03:31:13,940
jobs listed here on the left side and it tells me here that in the file that I

1278
03:31:13,940 --> 03:31:20,380
submitted the test checks whether I have ingredients as a section and it tells me

1279
03:31:20,380 --> 03:31:22,380
that I don't have any.

1280
03:31:22,380 --> 03:31:24,380
Now let's take a look at the code again,

1281
03:31:26,020 --> 03:31:28,420
which I can do here at clicking at files changed.

1282
03:31:31,940 --> 03:31:34,960
And it already shows me that there is something wrong.

1283
03:31:34,960 --> 03:31:39,900
And it tells me here that ingredients is not in,

1284
03:31:39,900 --> 03:31:44,740
let me just scroll to like show you full message here.

1285
03:31:44,740 --> 03:31:47,000
It's saying that this section is missing ingredients.

1286
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:48,020
And if I take a closer look,

1287
03:31:48,020 --> 03:31:50,940
I see I actually misspelled ingredients,

1288
03:31:50,940 --> 03:31:53,520
therefore test catches a mistake.

1289
03:31:53,520 --> 03:31:55,260
And I did this kind of on purpose

1290
03:31:55,260 --> 03:31:57,460
because in the previous lesson,

1291
03:31:57,460 --> 03:31:59,020
this mistake was already there

1292
03:31:59,020 --> 03:32:02,000
and [Name] and I were not able to spot it.

1293
03:32:02,860 --> 03:32:05,740
And now the automated test was able to spot the mistake.

1294
03:32:05,740 --> 03:32:10,500
Now this of course is kind of a artificial kind of test,

1295
03:32:12,860 --> 03:32:14,260
like usually in a code project,

1296
03:32:14,260 --> 03:32:17,380
which would be more relevant would be to add tests

1297
03:32:17,380 --> 03:32:19,220
that check the functions of the new implementations

1298
03:32:19,220 --> 03:32:20,060
in your code.

1299
03:32:20,060 --> 03:32:22,660
So whenever you submit something that changes something

1300
03:32:22,660 --> 03:32:25,300
in the code base, you can automatically test

1301
03:32:25,300 --> 03:32:26,380
whether it breaks anything

1302
03:32:26,380 --> 03:32:30,860
of the previously existing functionalities.

1303
03:32:32,020 --> 03:32:33,540
Or I can use this also very frequently,

1304
03:32:33,540 --> 03:32:34,860
but it's not very often to check

1305
03:32:34,860 --> 03:32:37,020
whether the code formatting is correct.

1306
03:32:37,020 --> 03:32:39,580
So these two things are usually done

1307
03:32:39,580 --> 03:32:41,400
in these GitHub actions.

1308
03:32:42,780 --> 03:32:45,900
But again, like in this case, which is really nice,

1309
03:32:45,900 --> 03:32:47,540
it showed us like there is a mistake here

1310
03:32:47,540 --> 03:32:49,620
which we, which slipped under our radar

1311
03:32:49,620 --> 03:32:52,680
when we were doing the code review manually.

1312
03:32:53,820 --> 03:32:57,420
Okay, another one, should I give the screen to you or?

1313
03:32:58,880 --> 03:33:00,220
Yes, give me a second.

1314
03:33:00,220 --> 03:33:05,220
I will take the screen and let me review it.

1315
03:33:05,660 --> 03:33:09,360
Let's now take the perspective of the person reviewing.

1316
03:33:15,900 --> 03:33:17,260
I will just refresh my page.

1317
03:33:23,260 --> 03:33:27,180
Um pull request one is open and one issue is open that's the one

1318
03:33:30,140 --> 03:33:32,220
and I will make the font larger.

1319
03:33:37,660 --> 03:33:41,660
So even without even before I click on the pull request itself I can see that

1320
03:33:41,660 --> 03:33:45,500
that, so the new thing this time is this,

1321
03:33:45,500 --> 03:33:48,120
is this, so there's a new symbol here.

1322
03:33:50,860 --> 03:33:52,240
And if I could, if I would click here,

1323
03:33:52,240 --> 03:33:53,840
I would see the same detail that,

1324
03:33:55,480 --> 03:33:57,500
ooh, no, I clicked on the wrong thing.

1325
03:33:58,520 --> 03:34:03,520
If I click on the X or on the details,

1326
03:34:03,740 --> 03:34:07,460
I would see the same what [Name] has just seen.

1327
03:34:08,780 --> 03:34:10,500
And now I know what the problem is,

1328
03:34:10,500 --> 03:34:13,320
and I also know how to fix it.

1329
03:34:13,320 --> 03:34:16,160
So let me first fix it and then I want to show you

1330
03:34:16,160 --> 03:34:18,520
how do we do this testing?

1331
03:34:19,400 --> 03:34:20,240
How does it work?

1332
03:34:20,240 --> 03:34:23,080
And then what does it make possible?

1333
03:34:25,200 --> 03:34:27,080
And it will only be a preview

1334
03:34:27,080 --> 03:34:30,160
because then next week we have a whole lesson

1335
03:34:30,160 --> 03:34:34,180
on automated testing and then we can go really in depth.

1336
03:34:35,960 --> 03:34:37,400
But let me first fix this.

1337
03:34:37,400 --> 03:34:45,160
we know how to review changes no i can go i can do it directly here no this one

1338
03:34:46,760 --> 03:34:53,240
it was the plus minus symbol in in not ingredients it's ingredients

1339
03:35:00,360 --> 03:35:01,080
and i will now

1340
03:35:01,080 --> 03:35:10,220
Well, I can keep the screen, but [Name] can't commit it, so just that I don't commit and

1341
03:35:10,220 --> 03:35:11,820
upload my own suggestions.

1342
03:35:11,820 --> 03:35:21,220
So maybe, maybe you can click on it, but we stay with my screen.

1343
03:35:21,220 --> 03:35:25,460
I don't even know whether something will change here automatically or I need to reload.

1344
03:35:25,460 --> 03:35:37,340
see. Yeah, actually, it did update. Yeah, I just updated it. And now the tests are running

1345
03:35:37,340 --> 03:35:41,260
again. If you scroll further down, you can see that the tests are running again. Oh,

1346
03:35:41,260 --> 03:35:50,100
they have passed. Yeah. Green checkmark all checks have passed and I can verify by going

1347
03:35:50,100 --> 03:36:02,420
to the details. And now everything is happy here. Zero errors. So something was happening

1348
03:36:02,420 --> 03:36:12,380
run Python checks recipes.py. Where does that come from? Well, first, let me merge it. Let

1349
03:36:12,380 --> 03:36:15,220
Let me first merge it and then let's talk about the testing.

1350
03:36:18,300 --> 03:36:19,140
Merge.

1351
03:36:23,220 --> 03:36:24,740
Just thinking whether this will do anything

1352
03:36:24,740 --> 03:36:25,700
with our exercise.

1353
03:36:25,700 --> 03:36:26,900
No, it's fine to merge.

1354
03:36:30,180 --> 03:36:32,380
Now we have it on the main branch.

1355
03:36:32,380 --> 03:36:33,700
How did the testing work?

1356
03:36:38,900 --> 03:36:39,740
We edit,

1357
03:36:39,740 --> 03:36:46,140
And now there is a symbol it's running again because the testing now runs not only we defined

1358
03:36:46,140 --> 03:36:52,660
it to run not only on each pull request but also on each modification of the main branch.

1359
03:36:52,660 --> 03:36:59,020
So there's this check recipes which is a little Python script that will check whether our

1360
03:36:59,020 --> 03:37:02,380
recipes contain ingredients and instructions.

1361
03:37:02,380 --> 03:37:08,380
It doesn't have to be Python and in real life it would verify something else.

1362
03:37:08,380 --> 03:37:10,700
So we don't have to go into this file really.

1363
03:37:10,700 --> 03:37:11,660
Of course, if you are curious,

1364
03:37:11,660 --> 03:37:14,240
you can click and see what is inside.

1365
03:37:14,240 --> 03:37:16,680
The really key thing here is this folder,

1366
03:37:18,300 --> 03:37:20,940
.github.com slash workflows.

1367
03:37:20,940 --> 03:37:23,440
And inside there, we can add scripts

1368
03:37:23,440 --> 03:37:25,980
and we can tell them that they should run automatically

1369
03:37:25,980 --> 03:37:29,340
every time we push or create a pull request

1370
03:37:29,340 --> 03:37:30,700
or create a release.

1371
03:37:32,320 --> 03:37:33,820
So I will go in there and see.

1372
03:37:38,380 --> 03:37:44,940
We have one recipe in there.

1373
03:37:44,940 --> 03:37:46,460
Well maybe recipes are confusing word.

1374
03:37:46,460 --> 03:37:49,740
We have one script.

1375
03:37:49,740 --> 03:37:52,980
And we gave it a name check recipes.

1376
03:37:52,980 --> 03:37:55,820
You could have several scripts here.

1377
03:37:55,820 --> 03:37:58,120
I will open it up.

1378
03:37:58,120 --> 03:38:05,100
And this here we define on each on each modification of the main branch on each pull request towards

1379
03:38:05,100 --> 03:38:20,280
the main branch, do a series of steps and run it on a Linux-like container.

1380
03:38:20,280 --> 03:38:27,880
You could here add, you could run tests on a macOS system or a Windows system.

1381
03:38:27,880 --> 03:38:33,100
I think you could even run them on your own custom container.

1382
03:38:33,100 --> 03:38:39,500
And the series of steps here, it's up to you to define what it is.

1383
03:38:39,500 --> 03:38:44,260
So what are typical things that we will want to do at a pull request?

1384
03:38:44,260 --> 03:38:48,820
One thing that we will see next week is, well, run a series of automated tests to make sure

1385
03:38:48,820 --> 03:38:56,260
that the functionality is still working.

1386
03:38:56,260 --> 03:39:02,480
Then another thing you might want to do automatically is to build the documentation.

1387
03:39:02,480 --> 03:39:04,380
We will learn how to do that next week.

1388
03:39:05,680 --> 03:39:06,640
Spell checking.

1389
03:39:08,520 --> 03:39:11,760
If I go back to our lesson and I zoom out,

1390
03:39:13,280 --> 03:39:16,200
if you want to browse our lesson in PDF format,

1391
03:39:16,200 --> 03:39:18,720
well, that PDF is generated automatically

1392
03:39:18,720 --> 03:39:22,000
as part of a workflow at every pull request.

1393
03:39:23,600 --> 03:39:25,360
So there are a lot, many things are possible.

1394
03:39:25,360 --> 03:39:27,500
You could automatically package your code.

1395
03:39:27,500 --> 03:39:32,240
You could even automatically upload your code

1396
03:39:32,240 --> 03:39:37,240
to services like Zenodo and get a digital object identifier.

1397
03:39:38,640 --> 03:39:42,200
I don't know what else we could do, lots of things.

1398
03:39:42,200 --> 03:39:44,240
So we will come back to that next week.

1399
03:39:44,240 --> 03:39:46,400
So this is just a preview.

1400
03:39:46,400 --> 03:39:50,440
So then when you practice in the next exercise

1401
03:39:51,500 --> 03:39:53,480
and the test is failing, I mean, don't feel bad.

1402
03:39:53,480 --> 03:39:57,920
This is a silly test that checks for certain sections.

1403
03:39:57,920 --> 03:39:59,960
We only want to show you what is possible.

1404
03:40:02,240 --> 03:40:06,800
Next week we will show you how to create these workflow files for your own projects.

1405
03:40:12,320 --> 03:40:12,820
Good.

1406
03:40:16,640 --> 03:40:20,000
There will be a second interesting thing that you will see in your exercise is that

1407
03:40:23,040 --> 03:40:31,440
the change that [Name] sent and that I merged, which was a new pasta recipe, pasta this one,

1408
03:40:32,240 --> 03:40:37,240
it is now on the main branch in this exercise repository.

1409
03:40:39,780 --> 03:40:43,620
But if we, maybe we can again switch perspective

1410
03:40:43,620 --> 03:40:44,940
and Gago takes the screen from me.

1411
03:40:44,940 --> 03:40:48,600
And if we go back to his view on his fork,

1412
03:40:49,940 --> 03:40:52,640
we will see the change is not there on the main branch.

1413
03:40:54,680 --> 03:40:57,240
Exactly, so I'm now on my fork.

1414
03:40:57,240 --> 03:40:58,860
And if I take a look at the commits,

1415
03:40:58,860 --> 03:41:01,360
I will only see the initial commit.

1416
03:41:01,360 --> 03:41:04,320
So whatever has been committed to the main branch now

1417
03:41:04,320 --> 03:41:07,040
of the original repository is not appearing here.

1418
03:41:07,920 --> 03:41:08,760
Yeah.

1419
03:41:08,760 --> 03:41:10,000
If I take, we'll take a look at that

1420
03:41:10,000 --> 03:41:12,200
and I would see there's already four commits

1421
03:41:15,240 --> 03:41:17,600
and these come from the pull request.

1422
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:20,320
Yes. So two of them were one,

1423
03:41:20,320 --> 03:41:21,840
when one was your pull request,

1424
03:41:21,840 --> 03:41:25,060
the second one was where we fixed the spelling mistake.

1425
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:28,100
And then the last one, which is the merge,

1426
03:41:28,100 --> 03:41:28,940
it's a merge commit.

1427
03:41:28,940 --> 03:41:30,240
So that's why we have four.

1428
03:41:31,360 --> 03:41:36,360
And then going back to your fork and there is,

1429
03:41:36,520 --> 03:41:37,960
we can actually see that it's behind

1430
03:41:37,960 --> 03:41:40,200
because it tells us there,

1431
03:41:40,200 --> 03:41:41,960
this branch is three commits behind

1432
03:41:44,040 --> 03:41:46,500
the upstream repository.

1433
03:41:47,600 --> 03:41:49,960
And now there is a two-click way of updating it

1434
03:41:49,960 --> 03:41:51,800
and you will do that in the exercise.

1435
03:41:52,840 --> 03:41:53,680
That is this.

1436
03:41:53,680 --> 03:41:54,760
Click on sync fork.

1437
03:41:54,760 --> 03:41:56,080
Exactly.

1438
03:41:56,080 --> 03:41:57,280
If you want, you can compare,

1439
03:41:57,280 --> 03:41:59,560
but I mean, we already know what the difference is.

1440
03:41:59,560 --> 03:42:02,040
it will be, it's just this one document.

1441
03:42:02,040 --> 03:42:03,680
So I can click on update branch.

1442
03:42:07,880 --> 03:42:09,360
And now it's identical again.

1443
03:42:09,360 --> 03:42:11,560
So if I now take a look at the full commits,

1444
03:42:13,280 --> 03:42:16,020
it will be the same as in the upstream branch.

1445
03:42:19,240 --> 03:42:21,440
So that will be an exercise step.

1446
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:28,680
And this was easy because we have been careful

1447
03:42:28,680 --> 03:42:31,900
of not really modifying the main branch.

1448
03:42:31,900 --> 03:42:33,300
It can be useful to,

1449
03:42:34,540 --> 03:42:37,060
okay, I'll just capture the screen.

1450
03:42:37,060 --> 03:42:39,980
It can be useful to consider the main branch

1451
03:42:39,980 --> 03:42:43,020
or the default branch as read-only.

1452
03:42:43,020 --> 03:42:45,520
For every new pull request, we create a new branch.

1453
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:49,260
And then it will be easy.

1454
03:42:49,260 --> 03:42:53,540
Our main branch in the fork will always be either up-to-date

1455
03:42:53,540 --> 03:42:56,460
or a little bit behind, but we'll never be ahead.

1456
03:42:56,460 --> 03:43:00,500
And then updating will be without any mistakes

1457
03:43:00,500 --> 03:43:01,860
and any problems.

1458
03:43:04,360 --> 03:43:05,380
You could just for fun,

1459
03:43:05,380 --> 03:43:07,820
try to actually modify your own main branch

1460
03:43:07,820 --> 03:43:10,660
and see what happens then if you try to update your fork,

1461
03:43:10,660 --> 03:43:12,580
whether this will work and what will happen.

1462
03:43:12,580 --> 03:43:15,500
So that can be an interesting thing to try.

1463
03:43:21,260 --> 03:43:23,820
And now looking at the time, timing is really good.

1464
03:43:23,820 --> 03:43:31,220
So we will soon start the exercise session and we have an exercise block here and it

1465
03:43:31,220 --> 03:43:35,420
will be we will give you half an hour which might be too much time but it's also then

1466
03:43:35,420 --> 03:43:41,820
nice to try some of these fun things out and or maybe catch up with what didn't work well

1467
03:43:41,820 --> 03:43:42,820
earlier.

1468
03:43:42,820 --> 03:43:50,260
A couple of things are already familiar and what is really new is listed here.

1469
03:43:50,260 --> 03:43:52,660
And again, at the bottom of the page,

1470
03:43:52,660 --> 03:43:55,620
we have screenshots of how does it look, where to click.

1471
03:43:57,820 --> 03:44:01,220
And then if you finish with the exercise

1472
03:44:01,220 --> 03:44:04,580
before half an hour,

1473
03:44:04,580 --> 03:44:06,060
have a look at the last section

1474
03:44:06,060 --> 03:44:07,660
where there are some thoughts,

1475
03:44:07,660 --> 03:44:09,780
and this can then form a basis for a discussion.

1476
03:44:09,780 --> 03:44:11,860
So the last half an hour of today

1477
03:44:11,860 --> 03:44:16,620
will be a Q&A session where we really open this up.

1478
03:44:16,620 --> 03:44:21,620
So I suggest that we will be back at 55 past.

1479
03:44:26,820 --> 03:44:28,100
We will be back here with a jingle.

1480
03:44:28,100 --> 03:44:28,980
I will say a few words.

1481
03:44:28,980 --> 03:44:30,820
We will then go into a short break

1482
03:44:31,820 --> 03:44:34,780
and then we will come back for a Q&A session.

1483
03:44:34,780 --> 03:44:37,080
So prepare many cues, many questions.

1484
03:44:40,260 --> 03:44:41,260
Have fun at the exercise.

1485
03:44:41,260 --> 03:44:42,660
Hope that works well.

1486
03:44:42,660 --> 03:44:45,060
Again, it will really help us if you let us know

1487
03:44:45,060 --> 03:44:51,300
Whether this worked well or where you are in the exercise step.

1488
03:44:51,300 --> 03:44:52,300
Good luck.

1489
03:44:52,300 --> 03:44:55,340
I just need to find the right button in my remote control.

1490
03:44:55,340 --> 03:44:56,060
See you in half an hour.

1491
03:45:15,060 --> 03:45:17,120
you

1492
03:45:45,060 --> 03:45:47,120

1493
