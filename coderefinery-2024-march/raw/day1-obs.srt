44
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,180
you would like a certificate for the course,

45
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,240
I think I've seen already a question about that

46
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,200
also in the collaborative documents.

47
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,780
In the local teams at universities, for example,

48
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,580
ask from your team leader,

49
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,700
and then you can find some general instructions

50
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,620
for these certificates behind this link on our work page.

51
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,040
And then once more, CodeRefiner is an open project.

52
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,900
You can get involved, you can join our chat.

53
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:22,300
We have some manuals on how we organize these workshops,

54
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,660
and we always need volunteers and partners

55
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:28,300
to continue making this also a success in the future.

56
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,020
And we are very happy to also welcome

57
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,080
new institutional partners.

58
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,580
And then if you like this workshop,

59
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:40,580
please share your experiences about it on social media

60
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,900
with this Code Refinery hashtag,

61
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,660
and we are also on Mustard on Twitter and LinkedIn.

62
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,020
And now I've already taken a few too many minutes,

63
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,180
so I will give over right away to Radovan and Gregor

64
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,180
who will guide you to our first steps into version control.

65
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,040
Thanks so much, Anatole.

66
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,000
Let me take the screen

67
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,460
and we should also tell again who we are,

68
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,060
the instructors, just a second.

69
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,600
I have the screen share.

70
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,180
So hi to everybody.

71
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,340
It's so nice to see so many people on the document

72
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,740
and on stream.

73
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,060
We are so excited about this workshop.

74
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,380
My name is Sadovan and together with Gago,

75
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,340
we are today teaching Git from Tromso, Northern Norway.

76
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,500
It's snowing here.

77
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,940
I work with the Code Refinery Project since its start.

78
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:40,940
So this is now, I think, eight years that we do this.

79
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,900
In my work, I like teaching, programming,

80
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,900
helping researchers and students with their coding,

81
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,900
so research software engineering,

82
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,820
and also supporting people in computing.

83
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:04,100
Yes, and maybe a quick hello from my co-instructor Gregor.

84
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,980
Yeah, hello from my side.

85
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,300
My name is Gregor.

86
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,860
I'm working with the same group as Radovan

87
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,060
here at UIT in Tromsø, Norway.

88
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,620
So it's the high-performance computing group,

89
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,800
but also the research engineering group.

90
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,300
I started recently and before that,

91
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,380
I did a postdoc here at the same university

92
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,060
in plasma physics in my case.

93
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,740
So I've worked a few years as a researcher as well.

94
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,780
Yeah, looking forward to this course.

95
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,940
And since we both have been researchers,

96
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,620
we know how it feels.

97
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:38,620
We both haven't kind of officially learned coding

98
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,540
in our university curriculum.

99
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,200
We did research and learned it a bit on the side.

100
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,040
We know the pain.

101
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:55,340
know what is needed. Before we go into get a little bit what to expect and how to participate.

102
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:04,860
So please expect we will do an exercise soon, roughly in 1520 minutes. We will then also

103
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:12,860
do a break in half an hour. And the two things that I always have open in my browser, and

104
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:18,860
You can have that maybe open next to the next to the stream on the other half of your screen

105
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,940
is I have the collaborative notes.

106
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,820
So we will be watching these as instructors and please keep the questions coming.

107
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,180
The more you ask, the more you comment, the better it will be.

108
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:37,620
We are following this and the best way to do it is to ask at the bottom because we already

109
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,020
have so many things open here on my side and on your side.

110
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,660
I will be watching what comes up at the bottom.

111
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,820
So add your questions,

112
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,420
add your comments to the bottom of the page.

113
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,880
You will also find always here where are we at this moment.

114
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,900
The other place that I have as a starting point

115
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,780
is the workshop page.

116
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:00,220
So if you get lost and you want to find the material,

117
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,540
you can also find it here through the schedule.

118
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,540
And we have now finished the introduction section.

119
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,500
Thanks to Samantha.

120
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,340
And now we will talk about Git and version control.

121
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,660
And I will now go into the first link, which is also in the collaborative notes.

122
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:25,020
And I want to tell you a little bit what to expect today and tomorrow and on Thursday.

123
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,740
There is a side panel here with lots of episodes.

124
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,780
We will not do all of them. There is a lot more than we chose to present.

125
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:43,360
But what we will present you is the most important parts.

126
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,540
The exciting thing is that we have a completely new Git lesson.

127
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,780
This is the first time we present it.

128
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,580
We have changed everything.

129
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:55,660
But hopefully to the better, because our goal was to make it possible for everybody to participate.

130
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:01,460
And you can actually choose your path, and I will tell you more about it in a moment.

131
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,800
I will now scroll down a little bit

132
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,640
just to give you an overview

133
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,440
and zoom in to make it more readable

134
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,220
so that you know what to expect today,

135
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,880
what to expect tomorrow.

136
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,960
We will now very briefly motivate why we do this.

137
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,360
And then the goal for today is these three episodes

138
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,100
to browse an existing project,

139
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,400
to make changes to an existing project,

140
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:36,000
and to merge changes that have been done

141
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,840
on different branches.

142
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:45,060
So today in day one, we learn how do we contribute

143
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,780
to an existing project that already exists.

144
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,900
And we imagine that today and tomorrow,

145
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,360
we want to learn Git for even if you work on your own,

146
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,460
even if you don't collaborate with others.

147
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,780
What are the most important techniques?

148
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:06,260
Tomorrow. Okay. And each of these three will have one exercise. So, so please expect 20

149
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:12,420
minutes, 25 minute exercise blocks in each of these three sessions today. And then tomorrow

150
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:20,180
we will move from, we will move the existing project and learn how do we work locally on

151
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:26,940
our computer? How do we inspect history of a project locally on our computer? And then

152
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,260
and super important since many of you already have a project,

153
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,980
you have a script, you have some code,

154
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,380
or you are about to start one.

155
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,420
How do you turn this project into a Git repository

156
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,260
and share it?

157
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,360
This is so important because we want to make it findable

158
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,200
and reusable.

159
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,960
So that's the plan.

160
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,440
I will now go into motivation.

161
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,940
Why do we do this?

162
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,620
So our goal is nobody leaves the workshop

163
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,700
without starting some form of version control.

164
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,060
We want to really get you excited about this.

165
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,700
And this will be a really short overview.

166
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,580
And what is Git?

167
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,500
And I see on the document that many of you are new to Git.

168
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,380
You can think of it as a tool that keeps track of changes.

169
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,820
And we will learn how to keep track of changes on the web.

170
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,980
And here's a screenshot and you can even browse

171
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,040
this example repository,

172
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,080
which I think is some of my projects.

173
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,380
So you can open it up in your browser and browse

174
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,460
and see what I was doing in 2017 and 2021.

175
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:46,060
We keep track of changes that we apply to the project.

176
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,880
And then whenever I want to go back

177
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,420
to a previous version, I can.

178
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,360
Some of you will also experiment with this

179
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,540
in your command line terminal.

180
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,040
Some of you will choose to do that in your editor.

181
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,400
So one way to think about Git would be,

182
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,080
it's like an undo button.

183
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,860
If you ever want to go back, something didn't work out,

184
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,740
you want to try an early version, you can do an undo,

185
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,480
but it can do a lot more than that.

186
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,840
And here are some questions that I have either heard

187
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:27,160
or I have asked, and maybe you recognize some of them.

188
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,620
For instance, oh, it broke.

189
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,120
Oof, hopefully I have a working version somewhere.

190
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,300
Or can you please send me the latest version?

191
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,920
Or where is the latest version?

192
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,020
Maybe you have asked, which version are you using?

193
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,820
Which version have the authors used

194
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,620
in the paper that I'm trying to reproduce?

195
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:51,420
Or you found a problem and you want to know

196
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,740
how long was it there?

197
00:49:52,840 --> 00:50:00,960
And gets and version control is the answer to these questions.

198
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,980
So it can do a lot more than just rollback rollback is like an undo.

199
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:16,320
One thing we will learn already today is how to branch and merge and how to, and then on,

200
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,200
on Thursday, we will do collaboration.

201
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,400
But in order to do collaboration,

202
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,040
we have to understand branching.

203
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,400
It actually cannot go in Git.

204
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,920
We have to.

205
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,760
And what is branching?

206
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,920
We try to visualize it with these cute gophers.

207
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,280
In Git, you can work on different features

208
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,560
inside the same project.

209
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,320
And for this, you can create

210
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,880
these different development branches.

211
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,240
So on this branch, you can implement a new feature

212
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,360
to give this gopher sunglasses.

213
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,080
And on a different branch, it could be the graduation hat.

214
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,600
And then you can so-called merge these changes

215
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,400
into the main branch, recombine them.

216
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,240
So we don't have to wait for each other.

217
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,840
Also, if you want to experiment with something,

218
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,520
you can create this branch, experiment,

219
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,160
and then you can merge it or not.

220
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:20,160
Different people can work on the same code, same project,

221
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,680
without interfering.

222
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,240
And you can experiment with an idea and discard it

223
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,000
if it turns out it was a bad idea.

224
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,480
And Git is really good at that.

225
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,280
And finally, reproducibility.

226
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,280
This is really about making reproducible science,

227
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,180
reproducible computations and programs.

228
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,760
And if somebody asks you about your results

229
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,860
from some time ago, can you get the same results now?

230
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,680
And often you will want to reproduce somebody else's code

231
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,540
and then you are really happy if you can find

232
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,640
the precise version that the authors have used

233
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,960
in the paper you try to reproduce.

234
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,440
And there will be a day when you find a problem

235
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,760
and you will want to know

236
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,060
when precisely this bug got introduced.

237
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,520
Was it before I published a nature paper

238
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,360
or was it after?

239
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,060
I'm hoping it was after,

240
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,320
but at least I have a tool that tells me

241
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,660
when exactly it was introduced.

242
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,320
And we will, I will not go here to details

243
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,560
because we will actually practice this

244
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,580
in the first exercise.

245
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,640
You will be able to explore these tools.

246
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,340
You will see them in real life.

247
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,360
Just looking at the time,

248
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,260
I think we are still doing pretty okay.

249
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:43,260
Git also makes it easier for me to talk about code.

250
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,180
If I want to share with somebody a few lines of my project,

251
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,220
I can send them a link

252
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,260
and you can actually visit this permalink.

253
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,860
So if I want to tell you about this code that I wrote,

254
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,460
well, you can open it up in your browser

255
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,640
and you will see exactly what I'm talking about.

256
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,620
It's so much nicer than describing to you,

257
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:05,260
find a code, please go to the file, so-and-so,

258
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:09,420
search for the line that contains this text.

259
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,140
Oh, but please make sure that you use the version

260
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,640
from August, 2023.

261
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,220
And it's not just about software.

262
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:21,060
We can, with Git, we can version snapshots.

263
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,940
We can create these snapshots for software,

264
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,940
for scripts, documents, manuscripts, websites,

265
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,340
configuration files.

266
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,900
In the Code Refinery project,

267
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,020
we kind of use it for everything.

268
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:37,100
So the lesson that you see is on version control,

269
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:37,940
it's on Git.

270
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,420
The project website is on version control

271
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,060
and that will become all clear

272
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:47,780
as we show you the tools that we use

273
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,400
over the next two weeks.

274
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,180
Git is not the only tool,

275
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:57,100
but we show you a Git and GitHub

276
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,620
because they are the most popular versions of this.

277
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,500
I think I will not spend more time on the motivation.

278
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:14,900
I want to see whether there are any questions and there are not too many.

279
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,180
So please ask questions here.

280
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,260
You will make really the.

281
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,820
We want to keep it really interactive to see.

282
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,420
We don't really see you in the stream.

283
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,940
We hope you are doing well.

284
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,940
But one way.

285
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,940
Already a question.

286
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:34,100
There was already one question asking about why GitHub and not GitLab, for instance, so

287
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,700
maybe we could elaborate on that a bit.

288
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:37,700
Yes.

289
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:38,700
That's a very good question.

290
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:40,140
Why do we do that?

291
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:48,020
And when you go back to the lesson overview, we have all this blue box that answers it

292
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,660
because it is a really good question.

293
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:53,500
And we show you GitHub.

294
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,940
So we are not sponsored by GitHub.

295
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,780
We have no affiliation with GitHub.

296
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,020
we show you the service, which is owned by Microsoft,

297
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:00,980
which is proprietary,

298
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,980
because it is the most popular web hosting for Git.

299
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,300
And even if you choose other services,

300
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,420
like GitLab, like Bitbucket, and there are more,

301
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,660
and we will link to them,

302
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,860
it's, the probability is high that you

303
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,380
at least use somebody else's code that is on GitHub.

304
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,580
So we find it, it's probably useful for you

305
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,660
if you know how it works.

306
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,540
And all the things that we will learn with GitHub,

307
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,500
they also work with the other services.

308
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,420
And once you get the understanding of how it works,

309
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,700
it will be easy for you to move between those.

310
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,700
Good, thanks for keeping the questions coming.

311
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,740
Maybe just one quick comment about GitHub versus GitHub,

312
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:52,060
for instance.

313
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,180
My one motivation is also that most of the projects

314
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,980
that you will work with in the future

315
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,740
are most likely on GitHub

316
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,480
if they are publicly developed projects.

317
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,700
So therefore I think it makes sense

318
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:05,580
to get you familiar with the tools that GitHub provides.

319
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,940
There are some very small differences in how the UI looks,

320
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,820
like the user interface looks on the websites,

321
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,140
but it's nothing that stops you from using it.

322
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,580
And I really appreciate the comments that come in.

323
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,540
we might return to those.

324
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:26,560
I will now navigate to,

325
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,900
we are almost at the first exercise

326
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,780
and we will start with browsing.

327
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,180
So we will not make any changes yet,

328
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,940
but we will try to get an understanding

329
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,020
of an existing project.

330
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,420
So I will go to this episode here,

331
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,420
copy and browse an existing project.

332
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:56,380
And please help me pasting the link to the notes.

333
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:01,660
And we will give you a whoops, we will give you a short intro of what this is.

334
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:05,460
And then we will send you into an exercise, the exercise, you will be able to do on your

335
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,940
own or with a group.

336
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,220
And then after the exercise, we will take a break.

337
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:18,800
And then we will discuss the findings.

338
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:27,340
Here we prepared an existing project for you and the project is, it's a recipe book.

339
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:33,060
So we will not only learn how Git works, we will also have a nice recipe book of cooking

340
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:40,260
recipes which you can then use at home in your kitchen.

341
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:47,580
Our goal is to really give you an understanding of what are the building blocks.

342
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,760
What is really nice about this version that we present now for the very first time is

343
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,960
that we give you different paths, you can choose your own path.

344
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:04,960
You can spend everything we will do today, you can do on GitHub alone, if you want to.

345
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,760
So all you need is a GitHub account.

346
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,260
If you like for those who don't want to do that on GitHub, who would rather follow on

347
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:22,300
Visual Studio code, you can then choose to follow that path.

348
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,840
We also offer all the steps to do also on the command line.

349
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,160
So really you can choose.

350
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:37,840
And in future we plan to add more paths also for Jupyter, RStudio, Spyder, PyCharm, contributions

351
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:45,020
Welcome and we will start our very first step and I will demonstrate it but you can then

352
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:54,900
do it in the exercise is I will create a so-called fork and fork is a new term and think of it

353
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,460
as making a copy.

354
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:02,260
So I will create a copy of something called repository.

355
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,180
And if you want to know a little bit more about what is really a repository you can

356
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:11,740
even click on these and it will take you to, we have a quick reference and a glossary.

357
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:16,700
So it will explain you if some of the terms you never heard before, what is a fork? What

358
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:28,740
is a repository? You can read these nice descriptions. So I will show you that, but I want to tell

359
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:34,040
you that when you create this copy, you can then choose, we created this recipe book,

360
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,620
But we have two versions of it.

361
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,760
And you can choose which one you copy.

362
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:46,400
There is this one, the recipe book, and we have one which is called recipe book recorded.

363
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,500
Here on stream, I will only show the recorded one.

364
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,320
And this is just to make sure that those who don't want to, if you don't want your GitHub

365
00:59:54,320 --> 01:00:01,640
account, or anything you do, ever to show up in any recording or stream, then choose

366
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,520
this one.

367
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,440
But it will help us if few people work on this repository, because then we have something

368
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,280
to show here on stream.

369
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:19,740
Something that you will do then in the exercise is you can open it up in a browser tab.

370
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:23,200
And assuming that you have a GitHub account that you are logged in, and here we assume

371
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,740
that you went through the install instructions.

372
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:32,100
The first step you will do is to forget to make a copy and I can see that three copies

373
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:38,860
already exist. And I will create the fourth one. So what the first step will be to click

374
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:47,660
on this fork, boom. And then you can copy it into your own user account. And in this

375
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:54,900
case, this is my user. Yes, I want to keep the name. There is a description. Do I want

376
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:00,500
to copy the main branch only? Yeah, it doesn't matter. I think I want to copy everything.

377
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:07,460
not. And we didn't even tell you what is a branch, we will come back to that. So here

378
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:13,220
doesn't matter so much, but I will, I want to copy everything. And once I create the

379
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:22,260
fork, I it takes a few seconds. I have my own copy of it. And you can see that this

380
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:28,140
is your own copy. If on top left, you see your own username. And you can also see that

381
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,780
this has been copied from forked from this place.

382
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,240
And the rest of the exercise will be,

383
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,480
you will do it in this, inside this fork.

384
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,140
So the exercise steps are here.

385
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,340
And we know that you still need to learn how to do this.

386
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,700
So below the exercise,

387
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,700
you can find solutions walkthrough screenshots,

388
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,900
And you can choose your journey.

389
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,820
So choose your path.

390
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,260
Is it maybe GitHub?

391
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,020
So if you are unsure, just take the GitHub.

392
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,500
If you are sure you want something else,

393
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,280
then choose a different path.

394
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:14,180
And what we expect from you is to get an overview,

395
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,020
browse the commit history.

396
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:20,200
You will then see, visually see what are commits,

397
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,400
what are the changes.

398
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:27,400
You will see the network graph.

399
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,800
Maybe let me show you that

400
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,600
so that you know what to look out for.

401
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,600
So something that you will see in this insights network,

402
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,000
you will see that there are these commits,

403
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,040
changes, versions.

404
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,840
You will see that there are branches,

405
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,620
that there are different people.

406
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:57,820
And then we have a couple of questions for you, like when was a certain recipe in this

407
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:05,640
recipe book modified last, how many changes, which recipes include a certain ingredient.

408
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:11,220
So you will learn how to search through our Git repository.

409
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:19,900
And you will also learn how to find out when a certain certain line of code was modified

410
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,900
last.

411
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:24,380
So somebody actually modified the guacamole recipe.

412
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:29,260
And you will find out who added the cilantro to the recipe.

413
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:30,260
And then some more questions.

414
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,500
Can you use this recipe yourself?

415
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,060
Are you allowed to share modifications?

416
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,820
And also you will learn how to browse issues and so called pull requests.

417
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:44,300
and you should think about like what this might be good for.

418
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,380
We have hints.

419
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:48,140
So in each of these steps, there is a hint

420
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,580
and then please go through.

421
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,980
So this is not a spoiler, go through the solution,

422
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,600
go through the walk through and try this out.

423
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,960
And I think we will give you 20 minutes.

424
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,900
And then when we get back, we will take a break.

425
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,840
We will take a 10 minute break after the exercise.

426
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,080
And then after the break, Gregor and me

427
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,280
will show you some of the aspects

428
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,400
that are the most interesting,

429
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,620
maybe the most problematic,

430
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,840
and we will also react to the questions

431
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:24,180
that you have on the collaborative notes.

432
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:40,540
Here, on the bottom of the collaborative notes, where we are, what the expectation is.

433
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,140
So this is our first exercise.

434
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:52,300
It will be not until 55 past, but it will be up until six minutes past and then break.

435
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,420
I will modify that.

436
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:58,900
Try it out, see you after the exercise,

437
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,120
but then we will go into break

438
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,600
and then we will discuss more after the break.

439
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:05,900
Let us also know how it's going

440
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,660
through the, during the exercise, have fun.

441
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,560
See you then, bye.

442
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:24,360
you

443
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:54,360
you

444
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,360
you

445
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,360
you

446
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,360
you

447
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:54,360
you

448
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,360
you

449
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,360
you

450
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,360
you

451
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:54,360
you

452
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,360
you

453
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,360
you

454
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:24,360
you

455
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,360
you

456
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,360
you

457
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,360
you

458
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,360
you

459
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,360
you

460
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,360
you

461
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,360
you

462
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,360
you

463
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,360
you

464
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,360
you

465
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,360
you

466
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,360
you

467
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,360
you

468
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,360
you

469
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,360
you

470
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,360
you

471
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:54,360
you

472
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,360
you

473
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:54,360
you

474
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,360
you

475
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,360
you

476
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,360
you

477
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,360
you

478
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:24,360
you

479
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,360
you

480
02:02:22,300 --> 02:02:24,300
And, yeah, we'll take a minute.

481
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:26,300
Okay.

482
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,300
You're muted.

483
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,300
Okay.

484
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:32,300
You're muted.

485
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,300
Okay.

486
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:36,300
You're muted.

487
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,300
Okay.

488
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,300
You're muted.

489
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:42,300
Okay.

490
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:44,300
Okay.

491
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:46,300
Okay.

492
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:48,360
you

493
02:03:16,300 --> 02:03:18,360
you

494
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:48,360
you

495
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:18,360
you

496
02:04:46,300 --> 02:04:48,360
you

497
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,360
you

498
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:48,360
you

499
02:06:16,300 --> 02:06:18,360
you

500
02:06:46,300 --> 02:06:48,360
you

501
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:18,360
you

502
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:48,360
you

503
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:18,360
you

504
02:08:46,300 --> 02:08:48,360
you

505
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:18,360
you

506
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:48,360
you

507
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:18,360
you

508
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:48,360
you

509
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:18,360
you

510
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:48,360
you

511
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:18,360
you

512
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:48,360
you

513
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:18,360
you

514
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:48,360
you

515
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:25,660
Okay, so we are back. We have five minutes before the break starts. So there were two

516
02:14:25,660 --> 02:14:30,540
questions which arose, which I would like to discuss now. And if we have some time,

517
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:36,740
I can also quickly show how to use VS Code for creating commits. The first thing was

518
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:45,000
about comparing. And one, in my view, simplest way to create two different branches or commits

519
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:50,560
is by copying the URL and just writing compare at the end.

520
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:53,320
And this will then open this interface

521
02:14:53,320 --> 02:14:57,560
where we can then here choose which branches, repositories,

522
02:14:57,560 --> 02:14:58,360
we want to compare.

523
02:14:58,360 --> 02:15:02,680
So in this case, I will now just focus on mine.

524
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:04,240
And we can have here the main branch,

525
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:06,240
and we can compare it to the new recipe branch

526
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:08,360
that I created previously.

527
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:10,280
And this way, it will now show us

528
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:12,360
all the differences between the two branches.

529
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:14,360
So we see in this case, the only difference

530
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:19,160
is that we have the new file that I created previously,

531
02:15:19,160 --> 02:15:22,720
the tomato basil spaghetti recipe in this case.

532
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:27,640
So you will see something similar

533
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:28,800
when you create pull requests,

534
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:32,160
but that's something we will discuss later in this course.

535
02:15:32,160 --> 02:15:33,360
But in my view, that's the simplest way

536
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:35,280
of comparing it on GitHub itself.

537
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,680
So I hope this answers one of the questions.

538
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:42,560
Another question was there was some confusion

539
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:44,740
about the creating a tag.

540
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:48,960
And on GitHub, this can be some,

541
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,480
maybe a little bit confusing that it has a feature

542
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:52,960
which is called releases,

543
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:54,400
which is basically the same thing.

544
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:56,520
But the simplest way of creating one is just,

545
02:15:56,520 --> 02:15:57,680
let's just quickly go back.

546
02:15:57,680 --> 02:15:59,080
I click here on this button,

547
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:00,800
create a new release on the right.

548
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:07,520
And I can now choose a tag.

549
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:10,040
And now I need to actually write a new name into it

550
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:13,080
before I can create a new release or tag.

551
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:14,760
So I think this is the problem that arose there

552
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:18,360
and I think it's kind of counterintuitive in GitHub.

553
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:20,620
So if I now write new release, for instance,

554
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,660
then I can give it a title again.

555
02:16:31,080 --> 02:16:33,360
I can provide some more information, which I won't do now.

556
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,800
Then I can publish a release.

557
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:40,080
And Gregor, can I ask, or can we take a step back?

558
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:44,440
So when do you use branches, and when do you use tags?

559
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:48,680
And so how are they similar, how are they different, and when would you use one or the

560
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:49,680
other?

561
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:50,860
It's a very good question.

562
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:56,160
So branches I would use if I have a project where I still want to develop it, or still

563
02:16:56,160 --> 02:17:02,320
make changes to the project, with the idea that I would eventually merge them.

564
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:08,000
I would use tags then when I'm not planning to make any changes to this version of the project,

565
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:14,800
but I want them to be easily accessible in the future. For instance, if I want to have like this

566
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:19,840
specific version of a manuscript that I submitted to a journal, then it makes sense to have it as a

567
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:25,120
tag in my view, because branches somehow imply that I would do some changes. In fact, I have

568
02:17:25,120 --> 02:17:29,760
seen a few projects where they had like an own branch for the version that they submitted to a

569
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:35,440
journal or that was uploaded to archive, for instance, which I think isn't ideal because

570
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:39,280
these branches in theory can still be changed. Now, of course, I can always go to the history.

571
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:45,760
Since I'm using Git, I can always check what was the date when I submitted it, which was the

572
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:51,280
latest branch back then. But I think a tag makes more sense. This would be my answer to this

573
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:53,920
question. Thanks.

574
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,820
Thanks.

575
02:17:54,820 --> 02:17:55,660
Okay.

576
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:00,520
Shall I very briefly talk about VS code

577
02:18:00,520 --> 02:18:01,760
or shall we do that after the break?

578
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:03,320
What do you think about the one?

579
02:18:05,480 --> 02:18:06,480
Just looking at the time,

580
02:18:06,480 --> 02:18:09,160
I think we should do it after the break.

581
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:11,600
I'm just looking here to whether there's any questions

582
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:15,440
that we should pick up before we go into the break.

583
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:23,700
So let me thank everybody for the questions.

584
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:25,780
Let's have many more questions.

585
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:28,380
We want to be really overwhelmed by questions.

586
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:31,260
Let's take a, we will take a one hour break.

587
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:33,380
This is lunchtime in some time zones.

588
02:18:33,380 --> 02:18:36,220
We know that this is not ideal for everybody,

589
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:38,380
but in that hour, you can a little bit

590
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:41,580
process what we learned.

591
02:18:43,060 --> 02:18:45,180
And we will then do a recap.

592
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:51,700
And after the break, our plan is to learn how to

593
02:18:52,220 --> 02:18:53,620
merge the changes that we did.

594
02:18:53,620 --> 02:18:56,020
So we learn how to browse, how to create branch,

595
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:57,940
how to create commits,

596
02:18:57,940 --> 02:18:59,980
but how do we get all of these developments

597
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:02,380
back into the main branch

598
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:04,140
that we will learn after the break.

599
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,380
We will be back in one hour,

600
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:09,420
back here on stream.

601
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:13,300
See you then, have a good break,

602
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:14,340
and bye everybody.

603
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:25,680

740
03:55:22,620 --> 03:55:24,680
you

741
03:55:52,620 --> 03:55:54,680
you

742
03:56:22,620 --> 03:56:24,680
you

743
03:56:52,620 --> 03:56:54,680
you

744
03:57:22,620 --> 03:57:24,680
you

745
03:57:52,620 --> 03:57:54,680
you

746
03:58:22,620 --> 03:58:24,680
you

747
03:58:52,620 --> 03:58:54,680
you

748
03:59:22,620 --> 03:59:24,680
you

749
03:59:52,620 --> 03:59:54,680
you

750
04:00:22,620 --> 04:00:24,680
you

751
04:00:52,620 --> 04:00:54,680
you

752
04:01:22,620 --> 04:01:24,680
you

753
04:01:52,620 --> 04:01:54,680
you

754
04:02:22,620 --> 04:02:24,680
you

755
04:02:52,620 --> 04:02:54,680
you

756
04:03:22,620 --> 04:03:24,680
you

757
04:03:52,620 --> 04:04:17,140
Welcome back from exercise. I actually cannot hear the jingle if there was one on my side

758
04:04:17,140 --> 04:04:21,340
but maybe there was one, and hopefully you all enjoy it.

759
04:04:21,340 --> 04:04:26,180
Thanks to our colleague, Matthias, who created those.

760
04:04:26,180 --> 04:04:31,340
My plan is now that I want to go through the exercise,

761
04:04:31,340 --> 04:04:33,500
but show you the key steps,

762
04:04:33,500 --> 04:04:36,100
and I want to show you how we, how Gecko and we,

763
04:04:36,100 --> 04:04:40,940
how we look at pull requests when we create them

764
04:04:40,940 --> 04:04:45,540
and how we look at them when we merge them.

765
04:04:45,540 --> 04:04:49,100
and I also want to go through this step of deleting branches.

766
04:04:49,100 --> 04:04:52,020
And then we will take a very short break.

767
04:04:52,020 --> 04:04:54,220
So then only five minute break,

768
04:04:54,220 --> 04:04:57,140
and then we will back for conflict resolution.

769
04:04:58,900 --> 04:05:01,060
So let me go through the steps.

770
04:05:01,060 --> 04:05:04,060
I'm now here, top left is my mouse.

771
04:05:04,060 --> 04:05:05,580
I'm in my branch.

772
04:05:05,580 --> 04:05:09,140
I will now initiate a pull request.

773
04:05:12,780 --> 04:05:14,700
Let me get more space here.

774
04:05:14,700 --> 04:05:15,540
Oops.

775
04:05:17,680 --> 04:05:20,560
And the first thing I always verify is from where to where.

776
04:05:20,560 --> 04:05:25,560
So I want to go from this repository to this one.

777
04:05:26,280 --> 04:05:28,240
No, I want to go to my own one.

778
04:05:28,240 --> 04:05:31,840
So I will change this to my repository.

779
04:05:33,560 --> 04:05:36,800
And then I verify from which branch to which branch.

780
04:05:36,800 --> 04:05:38,240
From new recipe to main.

781
04:05:38,240 --> 04:05:39,600
Yes, that's what I wanted.

782
04:05:39,600 --> 04:05:45,920
I will change the title because a new recipe is not very descriptive.

783
04:05:45,920 --> 04:05:50,920
So we want to have a descriptive one-line title for this was so if I remember correctly

784
04:05:50,920 --> 04:06:00,600
it was so idea for a tasty pineapple salad.

785
04:06:00,600 --> 04:06:09,360
Here I can give more context more context for instance if if we discussed this earlier

786
04:06:09,360 --> 04:06:17,860
in an issue, I can refer to it. So more context, why I did this, what I did. And then what

787
04:06:17,860 --> 04:06:24,140
I personally do before clicking create pull request, I normally scroll down and I have

788
04:06:24,140 --> 04:06:33,420
a look. I had two commits. Are these the one that I intended to send? Yes. If I see some

789
04:06:33,420 --> 04:06:39,660
commits that I don't recognize, then I stop. I also scroll down to the bottom and I see

790
04:06:39,660 --> 04:06:47,780
what is the actual change. Is this the one that I wanted to send? Yes, this is the one.

791
04:06:47,780 --> 04:06:55,820
So this looks all pretty good. Note that here if I go on the little arrow I have a choice

792
04:06:55,820 --> 04:07:01,940
between create pull request and create draft pull request we will this thing can be really

793
04:07:01,940 --> 04:07:07,620
useful but we will come back to that on Thursday. I'm now ready to create a pull

794
04:07:07,620 --> 04:07:18,300
request. Did I forget anything? Hopefully not. Let's create it. When I create a pull

795
04:07:18,300 --> 04:07:24,180
request there is a new number here in the tab pull requests. Each pull request

796
04:07:24,180 --> 04:07:31,060
has a number so I can refer to them. This is the pull request number one.

797
04:07:31,940 --> 04:07:35,720
And before I review it and before I merge it,

798
04:07:37,840 --> 04:07:39,800
I will try to reload my network graph

799
04:07:39,800 --> 04:07:42,100
and it might take again a few seconds.

800
04:07:43,240 --> 04:07:45,040
But what I wanted to show you is that

801
04:07:45,040 --> 04:07:48,940
just by opening up a request, I didn't really,

802
04:07:51,520 --> 04:07:52,760
oh, nothing merged yet.

803
04:07:52,760 --> 04:07:55,060
The main branch didn't change yet.

804
04:07:57,320 --> 04:07:58,680
This is still my branch.

805
04:07:58,680 --> 04:08:03,020
The tasty pineapple recipe is still not on the main branch,

806
04:08:04,800 --> 04:08:06,080
but now let's review it.

807
04:08:08,240 --> 04:08:12,760
And when I merge a change proposal or request,

808
04:08:13,600 --> 04:08:18,600
I look at the same things, the title, what is the context?

809
04:08:22,340 --> 04:08:24,740
And notice that here we can even have a discussion.

810
04:08:24,740 --> 04:08:26,740
You can comment on it.

811
04:08:26,740 --> 04:08:29,020
You can say this is a good idea, this is a bad idea.

812
04:08:29,020 --> 04:08:32,300
You can give ideas for changes.

813
04:08:33,940 --> 04:08:37,660
More about that on Thursday.

814
04:08:37,660 --> 04:08:40,740
I also look at what are the commits

815
04:08:41,980 --> 04:08:43,100
and what has actually changed.

816
04:08:43,100 --> 04:08:45,000
I often click here, files changed.

817
04:08:49,060 --> 04:08:50,540
Yep, that looks pretty okay.

818
04:08:50,540 --> 04:08:52,980
I want to have that in my main branch.

819
04:08:56,740 --> 04:09:08,420
merge, merge, confirm

820
04:09:08,420 --> 04:09:18,780
and now it's merged, so when I now look at the network and reload it

821
04:09:18,780 --> 04:09:24,300
we will see a merge commit, we will see a new commit on main which combines these two

822
04:09:24,300 --> 04:09:35,260
developments. And while this is loading and refreshing, I can already, if I now check

823
04:09:35,260 --> 04:09:45,740
on my main branch, and I go to Salads, here I can find it. Here's the one. Has this finished

824
04:09:45,740 --> 04:09:52,700
in the meantime? It hasn't. Yes, here it is. Here's the merge commit. So now I have merged

825
04:09:52,700 --> 04:09:53,820
these two changes.

826
04:09:54,780 --> 04:09:56,260
And this is now a little bit hard to navigate

827
04:09:56,260 --> 04:09:57,980
because we have now so many collaborators

828
04:09:57,980 --> 04:09:59,940
that work on a very similar repository.

829
04:10:01,140 --> 04:10:03,160
But this is really what I wanted to do.

830
04:10:03,160 --> 04:10:04,560
So I'm happy with this.

831
04:10:06,620 --> 04:10:08,540
But now I want to go one step further.

832
04:10:08,540 --> 04:10:11,060
In the exercise, we asked you to,

833
04:10:11,060 --> 04:10:12,660
okay, scroll, scroll.

834
04:10:13,860 --> 04:10:16,320
We asked you to delete a branch.

835
04:10:16,320 --> 04:10:19,900
And what I will show you is that when I delete a branch,

836
04:10:19,900 --> 04:10:23,320
I will only delete this sticky note.

837
04:10:23,320 --> 04:10:25,060
I will not delete the commits.

838
04:10:25,060 --> 04:10:26,500
The commits will still remain there

839
04:10:26,500 --> 04:10:30,600
because the commits are now part of another branch.

840
04:10:31,880 --> 04:10:36,580
So what we wanted you to see that deleting branches

841
04:10:36,580 --> 04:10:39,460
doesn't necessarily delete commits.

842
04:10:39,460 --> 04:10:41,660
And we also wanted to show you

843
04:10:41,660 --> 04:10:44,000
how can you safely remove branches.

844
04:10:44,000 --> 04:10:53,200
One way is I can click on the button and then it's gone because here Git knows that GitHub

845
04:10:53,200 --> 04:10:55,680
knows that this has been merged.

846
04:10:55,680 --> 04:10:57,880
It is safe to delete the branch.

847
04:10:57,880 --> 04:11:01,480
It is safe to delete the sticky note.

848
04:11:01,480 --> 04:11:04,200
But what if I forget?

849
04:11:04,200 --> 04:11:06,440
I forgot.

850
04:11:06,440 --> 04:11:10,880
I navigated back.

851
04:11:10,880 --> 04:11:14,200
How can you find out which branches are safe to delete?

852
04:11:14,200 --> 04:11:15,200
You can also leave them there.

853
04:11:15,200 --> 04:11:18,120
I mean, they don't cost anything.

854
04:11:18,120 --> 04:11:20,720
No problem to have them there.

855
04:11:20,720 --> 04:11:23,720
But after a while, maybe you will have, I have now five branches.

856
04:11:23,720 --> 04:11:28,760
After a while, you might have 50 branches and you want to do some cleanup.

857
04:11:28,760 --> 04:11:40,000
So what I sometimes do is I navigate here to the branches, top left.

858
04:11:40,000 --> 04:11:46,720
And this is a little bit tiny font, but this symbol here tells me that this branch has

859
04:11:46,720 --> 04:11:52,880
been merged.

860
04:11:52,880 --> 04:11:54,880
This one has been merged, the new recipe.

861
04:11:54,880 --> 04:12:01,800
It is absolutely safe to delete it, your trashcan.

862
04:12:01,800 --> 04:12:03,240
And now it's deleted.

863
04:12:03,240 --> 04:12:14,880
And if I now reload this page, I would have to wait a few seconds. The commit will still

864
04:12:14,880 --> 04:12:27,240
be here. But this sticky note would be gone. That's all we did with deleting branches.

865
04:12:27,240 --> 04:12:28,240
Super

866
04:12:28,240 --> 04:12:33,240
And my suggestion is that we will take a five minute break

867
04:12:36,280 --> 04:12:39,340
and then Gregor and me will return to step number seven

868
04:12:39,340 --> 04:12:44,340
and we will do a pull request.

869
04:12:44,980 --> 04:12:47,640
We will show you a pull request across repositories.

870
04:12:49,400 --> 04:12:53,020
And at the same time, we will try to create a conflict,

871
04:12:53,020 --> 04:12:54,740
but it will be a conflict

872
04:12:54,740 --> 04:12:57,940
between two different code versions.

873
04:12:57,940 --> 04:13:05,940
So it will be very friendly and the humans will help the programs to resolve the conflict.

874
04:13:08,940 --> 04:13:10,640
Sounds good.

875
04:13:10,640 --> 04:13:14,840
Just catching up here with any questions.

876
04:13:14,840 --> 04:13:16,840
Yeah, so let's take a break until the full hour.

877
04:13:16,840 --> 04:13:20,040
So until...

878
04:13:20,040 --> 04:13:22,640
I need to make that visible.

879
04:13:22,640 --> 04:13:25,560
here, break until the full hour.

880
04:13:25,560 --> 04:13:30,520
And then we show you some conflict resolution

881
04:13:30,520 --> 04:13:33,120
in Git directly on GitHub.

882
04:13:35,640 --> 04:13:37,600
See you in five minutes.

883
04:13:37,600 --> 04:13:38,440
Bye.

884
04:13:52,640 --> 04:13:54,700
you

885
04:14:22,640 --> 04:14:24,700
you

886
04:14:52,640 --> 04:14:54,700
you

887
04:15:22,640 --> 04:15:24,700
you

888
04:15:52,640 --> 04:15:54,700
you

889
04:16:22,640 --> 04:16:24,700
you

890
04:16:52,640 --> 04:16:54,700
you

891
04:17:22,640 --> 04:17:24,700
you

892
04:17:52,640 --> 04:17:54,700
you

893
04:18:22,640 --> 04:18:24,700
you

894
04:18:52,640 --> 04:19:19,920
And welcome back for the last half an hour of today.

895
04:19:19,920 --> 04:19:30,500
Here we will continue on the idea of creating these change proposals pull requests on GitHub.

896
04:19:30,500 --> 04:19:33,600
But now we want to take it a step further.

897
04:19:33,600 --> 04:19:40,880
Because what I will try to do is I will try to create a pull request between my repository

898
04:19:40,880 --> 04:19:45,400
and towards the one that I forked from.

899
04:19:45,400 --> 04:19:48,640
At the same time, we will, with Kaggle,

900
04:19:48,640 --> 04:19:53,160
we will try to change the same recipe

901
04:19:55,120 --> 04:19:57,760
in two different ways, and we will see what happens

902
04:19:57,760 --> 04:19:59,040
and how do we deal with it.

903
04:19:59,040 --> 04:20:00,720
Because that can happen in real life,

904
04:20:00,720 --> 04:20:02,080
that you work with somebody

905
04:20:02,940 --> 04:20:06,740
and you modify the same portion of the file

906
04:20:06,740 --> 04:20:07,840
in two different ways.

907
04:20:09,400 --> 04:20:12,160
Let's see how Git deals with this.

908
04:20:12,160 --> 04:20:14,780
Also note that when I'm now on my fork,

909
04:20:14,780 --> 04:20:19,100
it informs me that this branch, which is the main branch,

910
04:20:20,100 --> 04:20:25,100
seems to be four commits ahead of the one that I forked from.

911
04:20:29,740 --> 04:20:34,180
That's interesting because that also shows me

912
04:20:34,180 --> 04:20:38,860
that the fork and the so-called upstream,

913
04:20:38,860 --> 04:20:43,860
they don't automatically synchronize somehow magically.

914
04:20:44,780 --> 04:20:51,620
I have to, we can synchronize it, but we have to do it actively.

915
04:20:51,620 --> 04:20:57,340
So until I do it, they are really separate repositories with their separate histories.

916
04:20:57,340 --> 04:20:58,340
Why four commits?

917
04:20:58,340 --> 04:21:01,180
What are the four commits?

918
04:21:01,180 --> 04:21:07,300
I did two commits on the new recipe branch.

919
04:21:07,300 --> 04:21:09,580
I did a different commit on the main branch.

920
04:21:09,580 --> 04:21:10,580
So three.

921
04:21:10,580 --> 04:21:11,580
Where is the fourth one?

922
04:21:11,580 --> 04:21:14,020
The fourth one was the merge commit.

923
04:21:14,020 --> 04:21:17,820
It was the one where I combined new recipe with main.

924
04:21:17,820 --> 04:21:20,980
So my branch is four commits ahead.

925
04:21:20,980 --> 04:21:27,760
But now I will try to create a new change, and let's see what we do.

926
04:21:27,760 --> 04:21:36,500
I will create a new branch, and I will call it another recipe.

927
04:21:36,500 --> 04:21:38,300
It's not a great name.

928
04:21:38,300 --> 04:21:40,060
It's also good if the branches are,

929
04:21:42,340 --> 04:21:44,340
if the branch name is descriptive.

930
04:21:44,340 --> 04:21:46,240
Let me take a descriptive branch name.

931
04:21:47,500 --> 04:21:50,380
I personally like to call my branches with my name

932
04:21:51,300 --> 04:21:53,500
because then I can find them again

933
04:21:53,500 --> 04:21:55,320
and what I'm doing on the branch.

934
04:21:55,320 --> 04:21:57,480
So in this case, I will do,

935
04:22:00,380 --> 04:22:04,200
I will make a change to modify guacamole.

936
04:22:06,940 --> 04:22:08,120
So now everybody, please watch.

937
04:22:08,120 --> 04:22:10,760
So now no more exercise, you don't have to,

938
04:22:10,760 --> 04:22:13,120
you don't have to do the same thing.

939
04:22:13,120 --> 04:22:16,360
Now, please watch and let's see if I,

940
04:22:18,840 --> 04:22:20,280
if I make some mistakes

941
04:22:20,280 --> 04:22:21,760
and please continue asking the questions.

942
04:22:21,760 --> 04:22:23,600
So I'm seeing the questions coming in.

943
04:22:24,840 --> 04:22:26,120
I create this branch.

944
04:22:30,320 --> 04:22:32,160
What do I need to do now?

945
04:22:32,160 --> 04:22:33,600
Oh yeah, here, create branch.

946
04:22:34,600 --> 04:22:35,440
Yes.

947
04:22:35,440 --> 04:22:39,840
And here it is, so I'm on the new branch.

948
04:22:39,840 --> 04:22:40,840
And guess what?

949
04:22:40,840 --> 04:22:49,800
I will now modify the guacamole, which happens to be here, sides, guacamole.

950
04:22:49,800 --> 04:22:55,880
And I can modify it directly here, the pen button on top right, edit.

951
04:22:55,880 --> 04:22:59,140
What should we do with it?

952
04:22:59,140 --> 04:23:02,360
So I personally am not a big fan of cilantro.

953
04:23:02,360 --> 04:23:13,900
What I will do is I will reduce the cilantro amount to 0.5 tablespoons.

954
04:23:13,900 --> 04:23:20,580
Something I like to do when I do this on GitHub is I switch on the preview so that I can see

955
04:23:20,580 --> 04:23:23,660
what did I actually change.

956
04:23:23,660 --> 04:23:39,580
showed it here I removed one I added 0.5 that looks good and now I want to commit change

957
04:23:39,580 --> 04:23:43,620
on the branch

958
04:23:43,620 --> 04:23:48,780
this is not a good commit message because it's it tells me what file I change but it

959
04:23:48,780 --> 04:23:52,160
it doesn't really summarize what I did.

960
04:23:52,160 --> 04:23:54,020
A much better commit message would be

961
04:23:55,160 --> 04:23:56,960
reduce the cilantro amount.

962
04:23:58,780 --> 04:24:00,000
And why did I change it?

963
04:24:00,000 --> 04:24:02,200
Well, because I'm not a fan.

964
04:24:07,800 --> 04:24:09,520
Does this look okay?

965
04:24:09,520 --> 04:24:10,800
Yes.

966
04:24:10,800 --> 04:24:13,000
Do the Guacamole branch commit changes.

967
04:24:13,000 --> 04:24:27,800
If I now go back to my repository on top, there is this yellow field that also some

968
04:24:27,800 --> 04:24:28,800
people were wondering about.

969
04:24:28,800 --> 04:24:29,800
What is that?

970
04:24:29,800 --> 04:24:33,640
This is because GitHub now recognized that I have a new branch.

971
04:24:33,640 --> 04:24:36,640
I modified it recently.

972
04:24:36,640 --> 04:24:38,480
I maybe want to create a pull request.

973
04:24:38,480 --> 04:24:39,480
Yes.

974
04:24:39,480 --> 04:24:40,480
Thank you.

975
04:24:40,480 --> 04:24:41,480
I want to.

976
04:24:41,480 --> 04:24:42,480
So this can be helpful sometimes.

977
04:24:42,480 --> 04:24:44,640
If you don't want to create a pull request, just ignore it.

978
04:24:44,640 --> 04:24:46,300
But I really want to.

979
04:24:47,920 --> 04:24:48,820
And this time,

980
04:24:50,760 --> 04:24:52,620
I want to create the pull request,

981
04:24:52,620 --> 04:24:55,920
not inside the same repository.

982
04:24:55,920 --> 04:24:58,700
I really want to send it to Code Refinery recipe book.

983
04:24:59,640 --> 04:25:00,480
So this looks good.

984
04:25:00,480 --> 04:25:02,580
From my branch, from my repository,

985
04:25:03,680 --> 04:25:06,920
towards the main branch, Code Refinery recipe book.

986
04:25:09,800 --> 04:25:11,620
Let's summarize it in a title.

987
04:25:12,480 --> 04:25:16,160
reduce cilantro amount

988
04:25:19,440 --> 04:25:24,960
more description if needed again i scroll down what is the change

989
04:25:28,560 --> 04:25:32,560
here is the change now how come i see all these other things

990
04:25:37,680 --> 04:25:40,480
which i didn't modify now this is because

991
04:25:42,480 --> 04:25:46,880
my main branch was four commits ahead

992
04:25:46,880 --> 04:25:49,080
and I created this new,

993
04:25:49,080 --> 04:25:51,560
I created this, what was it called?

994
04:25:52,600 --> 04:25:54,640
The other one modified guacamole from main,

995
04:25:54,640 --> 04:25:56,120
which was four commits ahead.

996
04:25:56,120 --> 04:26:01,120
So what I see here is not only the cilantro change,

997
04:26:01,800 --> 04:26:03,720
but also all my other local changes.

998
04:26:05,080 --> 04:26:07,080
This is fine, but maybe this is a bit misleading.

999
04:26:07,080 --> 04:26:09,480
So it's not only the cilantro amount,

1000
04:26:09,480 --> 04:26:14,480
it's also plus new salad recipe.

1001
04:26:20,280 --> 04:26:22,760
So here I bake together a couple of unrelated changes

1002
04:26:22,760 --> 04:26:25,920
into the same pull request.

1003
04:26:25,920 --> 04:26:28,880
Not the best practice, but happens.

1004
04:26:33,960 --> 04:26:38,560
And now I will open the pull request.

1005
04:26:39,480 --> 04:26:48,040
Oh, there are already 18 pull requests, wonderful.

1006
04:26:48,040 --> 04:26:49,480
We will review them later.

1007
04:26:49,480 --> 04:26:53,600
We will maybe not have time now, but thanks to everybody else who sent pull requests.

1008
04:26:53,600 --> 04:26:58,960
This is really cool because we can now build together a recipe book.

1009
04:26:58,960 --> 04:27:02,320
But I suggest that now we switch the screen to Gregor and Gregor makes a pull request,

1010
04:27:02,320 --> 04:27:07,720
which will also modify the guacamole recipe, but in a different way.

1011
04:27:07,720 --> 04:27:09,320
and let's see what happens then.

1012
04:27:23,720 --> 04:27:24,920
And Gregor, you're muted.

1013
04:27:27,320 --> 04:27:29,480
Thanks for telling me.

1014
04:27:29,480 --> 04:27:34,000
So I'm now on my fork of the recipe book recorded repository

1015
04:27:35,600 --> 04:27:37,360
and I will now change the same recipe

1016
04:27:37,360 --> 04:27:39,320
that Radovan has changed before.

1017
04:27:40,440 --> 04:27:43,040
In fact, in the previous exercise,

1018
04:27:43,040 --> 04:27:44,160
I changed the amount already,

1019
04:27:44,160 --> 04:27:48,240
but I will now increase it to two tablespoons of cilantro.

1020
04:27:48,240 --> 04:27:49,640
Oh, go for three.

1021
04:27:49,640 --> 04:27:50,840
I'll go for three, okay.

1022
04:27:53,400 --> 04:27:55,500
So I will now make a commit.

1023
04:27:55,500 --> 04:28:00,500
So I will now say, increase amount of cilantro.

1024
04:28:02,880 --> 04:28:05,640
Again, I could provide some more extended description,

1025
04:28:05,640 --> 04:28:07,360
is, I don't know, I really like

1026
04:28:13,880 --> 04:28:14,840
cilantro, for instance,

1027
04:28:14,840 --> 04:28:17,220
and of course provide some more explanations.

1028
04:28:17,220 --> 04:28:19,040
But for now, that should be enough.

1029
04:28:19,040 --> 04:28:22,040
I will now commit the changes.

1030
04:28:22,040 --> 04:28:23,760
So I have created now a new commit.

1031
04:28:23,760 --> 04:28:25,360
So if I go back to my repository,

1032
04:28:28,840 --> 04:28:31,040
I will see now again, if I click on commits,

1033
04:28:35,640 --> 04:28:38,120
Oh, sorry, that's the wrong branch, my bad.

1034
04:28:38,120 --> 04:28:41,860
So I go now to the change cilantro branch.

1035
04:28:43,000 --> 04:28:45,540
And I take a look at the commits, it should appear now.

1036
04:28:46,920 --> 04:28:47,840
And it does.

1037
04:28:47,840 --> 04:28:50,580
So increase amount of cilantro, that's fine.

1038
04:28:50,580 --> 04:28:52,940
And now I compare pull requests.

1039
04:28:55,840 --> 04:28:57,400
Create a pull request.

1040
04:28:57,400 --> 04:29:00,480
So I go and choose the repository I want to

1041
04:29:01,540 --> 04:29:02,960
merge my changes to.

1042
04:29:02,960 --> 04:29:06,340
So this would then be co-definery recipe book recorded.

1043
04:29:06,340 --> 04:29:07,180
That's fine.

1044
04:29:07,180 --> 04:29:08,020
I enter the main branch

1045
04:29:08,020 --> 04:29:11,260
and I do it from my local branch here,

1046
04:29:11,260 --> 04:29:13,660
which is in my namespace

1047
04:29:13,660 --> 04:29:18,660
and I use the change cilantro branch.

1048
04:29:18,700 --> 04:29:20,700
So I can now say, again,

1049
04:29:20,700 --> 04:29:22,700
I should also provide a title which is more descriptive.

1050
04:29:22,700 --> 04:29:27,140
So increase cilantro in,

1051
04:29:27,140 --> 04:29:32,140
Oh, remind me of the way, it's okay.

1052
04:29:36,940 --> 04:29:38,060
Guacamole recipe.

1053
04:29:39,300 --> 04:29:41,380
Then I quickly check the changes.

1054
04:29:41,380 --> 04:29:43,700
In this case, I have two commits.

1055
04:29:43,700 --> 04:29:45,620
One in the first, which was in the previous exercise,

1056
04:29:45,620 --> 04:29:47,400
where I reduced it, now I increased it.

1057
04:29:47,400 --> 04:29:49,380
And here, down here again, I see the changes

1058
04:29:49,380 --> 04:29:51,140
actually in the files directly.

1059
04:29:51,140 --> 04:29:52,740
So this is what I want to merge.

1060
04:29:52,740 --> 04:29:55,260
And I can see here that I increased the amount

1061
04:29:55,260 --> 04:30:02,580
Cilantro by free. So I will now create the pull request and then I will give the

1062
04:30:02,580 --> 04:30:05,820
screen back to another one.

1063
04:30:06,980 --> 04:30:12,460
All righty, I will take the screen and let's see how it looks on my side.

1064
04:30:13,140 --> 04:30:16,580
Just a sec.

1065
04:30:18,220 --> 04:30:21,500
Here I have it.

1066
04:30:25,260 --> 04:30:30,260
And I'm now looking at the, that's not my fork,

1067
04:30:31,340 --> 04:30:33,720
that's the central repository.

1068
04:30:34,700 --> 04:30:37,340
And I clicked on the pull requests map.

1069
04:30:37,340 --> 04:30:39,300
There are 21 open, 22 now.

1070
04:30:40,580 --> 04:30:41,780
Thanks to all of you,

1071
04:30:41,780 --> 04:30:45,260
we will look through them and merge them.

1072
04:30:45,260 --> 04:30:47,140
Maybe some of you tried to merge these

1073
04:30:47,140 --> 04:30:49,580
and now you realize that you cannot.

1074
04:30:49,580 --> 04:30:50,760
And this is a bit by design,

1075
04:30:50,760 --> 04:30:53,560
but now because now only the code refinery team

1076
04:30:53,560 --> 04:30:57,640
has the permissions to merge and modify this repository.

1077
04:30:58,480 --> 04:31:01,680
But don't worry, we will on Thursday

1078
04:31:01,680 --> 04:31:04,440
when we really practice collaboration,

1079
04:31:04,440 --> 04:31:06,360
we will create exercise repositories

1080
04:31:06,360 --> 04:31:09,320
where you also have permissions to review

1081
04:31:09,320 --> 04:31:11,160
and merge and modify those.

1082
04:31:12,120 --> 04:31:16,280
So then you will also practice being the person

1083
04:31:16,280 --> 04:31:17,880
who is reviewing these changes.

1084
04:31:20,600 --> 04:31:23,360
So now I want to focus on two changes.

1085
04:31:23,360 --> 04:31:27,220
One is the one that I created,

1086
04:31:27,220 --> 04:31:30,900
and the other one is the one that Gregor created.

1087
04:31:30,900 --> 04:31:34,020
And now I will do something which is not super nice.

1088
04:31:34,020 --> 04:31:35,500
I shouldn't really review my own changes,

1089
04:31:35,500 --> 04:31:36,780
but now for the sake of time,

1090
04:31:36,780 --> 04:31:39,700
I don't want to switch too much back and forth.

1091
04:31:39,700 --> 04:31:43,080
I will review my own change.

1092
04:31:45,360 --> 04:31:46,860
And of course it's excellent,

1093
04:31:46,860 --> 04:31:49,780
but I will still double check here.

1094
04:31:49,780 --> 04:31:51,980
Is this what I really wanted?

1095
04:31:51,980 --> 04:31:53,740
what's happening here, lots of changes,

1096
04:31:53,740 --> 04:31:57,220
but that looks pretty okay.

1097
04:31:57,220 --> 04:32:02,220
Overall, I will merge it into main branch.

1098
04:32:08,940 --> 04:32:11,660
And now it is, is it safe to delete?

1099
04:32:11,660 --> 04:32:13,660
Yes, it's safe to delete.

1100
04:32:13,660 --> 04:32:18,340
Now it is on the main branch in the central repository.

1101
04:32:19,500 --> 04:32:20,340
And that worked.

1102
04:32:20,340 --> 04:32:28,260
But let's see what happens when I now try to merge Gregor's change.

1103
04:32:28,260 --> 04:32:35,720
This one, the pull request number 39.

1104
04:32:35,720 --> 04:32:39,440
Here we go.

1105
04:32:39,440 --> 04:32:43,020
Something is different here and it's this one.

1106
04:32:43,020 --> 04:32:49,960
It doesn't let me merge, I can't really click here because there are conflicts.

1107
04:32:49,960 --> 04:32:51,080
And why are there conflicts?

1108
04:32:51,080 --> 04:32:55,640
Because on two different branches, we have changed the same portion in two different

1109
04:32:55,640 --> 04:32:56,640
ways.

1110
04:32:56,640 --> 04:33:01,240
The Git now doesn't know which one do we want to keep, like, do we want to keep the one

1111
04:33:01,240 --> 04:33:03,280
that is now on main?

1112
04:33:03,280 --> 04:33:08,720
Or do I want to keep the one that the change that comes in from this other branch, and

1113
04:33:08,720 --> 04:33:12,240
we have to help get deciding.

1114
04:33:12,240 --> 04:33:17,120
It's really good that it stops here, because it doesn't, it will not just accidentally

1115
04:33:17,120 --> 04:33:29,900
let Gago override my changes. So it stops here. It, it needs some human advice. So let's try

1116
04:33:29,900 --> 04:33:36,280
it together. And you can, you can do it in many different ways, but we will try it here

1117
04:33:36,280 --> 04:33:42,980
directly on GitHub and Gago will help me. So I click first on resolve conflicts just

1118
04:33:42,980 --> 04:33:53,740
just to see what is the conflict.

1119
04:33:53,740 --> 04:33:58,780
And it doesn't now show me all the, if you remember, I have changed a couple of files.

1120
04:33:58,780 --> 04:34:02,460
It was, I changed guacamole, but there was also some pineapple salad and there was some

1121
04:34:02,460 --> 04:34:05,140
other change.

1122
04:34:05,140 --> 04:34:13,000
But we only conflict in this one file, and we only conflict in this one portion.

1123
04:34:13,000 --> 04:34:22,900
These that I see here, these symbols are so-called conflict markers, they tell me where

1124
04:34:22,900 --> 04:34:25,280
is the conflict.

1125
04:34:25,280 --> 04:34:33,460
And the conflict is between main and between the main branch, and the change cylinder branch.

1126
04:34:33,460 --> 04:34:35,980
On the main branch, I reduced it to 0.5.

1127
04:34:35,980 --> 04:34:42,460
On the ChangeCylinder branch, it was changed from 1 to 3.

1128
04:34:42,460 --> 04:34:46,340
And we need to decide now.

1129
04:34:46,340 --> 04:34:55,940
And I will now not take my own version, but I will take this version.

1130
04:34:55,940 --> 04:34:59,620
And the way to resolve a conflict is, and whether you are on GitHub or whether you are

1131
04:34:59,620 --> 04:35:03,980
and your editor, that's to decide which version.

1132
04:35:03,980 --> 04:35:06,900
And then don't forget to remove these markers also.

1133
04:35:06,900 --> 04:35:07,840
They should not stay there.

1134
04:35:07,840 --> 04:35:12,840
So I will, I decide to keep three, remove these markers.

1135
04:35:18,240 --> 04:35:22,040
And once we are happy, mark it as resolved.

1136
04:35:22,040 --> 04:35:36,240
And now what we don't see because I'm zoomed in is that on the top right there is a button

1137
04:35:36,240 --> 04:35:37,240
commit merge.

1138
04:35:37,240 --> 04:35:44,880
I also this resolution needs to be committed to be a new commit that decides between the

1139
04:35:44,880 --> 04:35:47,760
two versions.

1140
04:35:47,760 --> 04:36:03,420
the merge. So these were, Gregor did in fact two commits, one was this one, one was this.

1141
04:36:03,420 --> 04:36:08,580
Where does this come from? This was my resolution commit. The conflict resolution created a

1142
04:36:08,580 --> 04:36:17,460
new commit because it merges between Gregor's branch and the main branch.

1143
04:36:17,460 --> 04:36:19,740
Now, before I merge it, I want to review

1144
04:36:19,740 --> 04:36:21,820
what did we get at the end.

1145
04:36:21,820 --> 04:36:22,940
Files changed.

1146
04:36:27,660 --> 04:36:32,500
At the end, it's changed from 0.5 to three.

1147
04:36:33,860 --> 04:36:34,700
Are we happy?

1148
04:36:34,700 --> 04:36:35,940
We are happy.

1149
04:36:35,940 --> 04:36:36,780
Let's merge.

1150
04:36:39,300 --> 04:36:42,380
This was a relatively easy conflict.

1151
04:36:42,380 --> 04:36:49,020
Sometimes, the conflict will require that you actually talk to the other person and

1152
04:36:49,020 --> 04:36:55,960
discuss with them on, maybe you schedule a video call, but at least now you know technically

1153
04:36:55,960 --> 04:37:04,920
on how to tell Git which version you like better.

1154
04:37:04,920 --> 04:37:11,620
Back to the lesson, I will now scroll down to the summary.

1155
04:37:11,620 --> 04:37:12,460
What did we learn?

1156
04:37:12,460 --> 04:37:13,460
And what did we learn in this lesson?

1157
04:37:13,460 --> 04:37:14,940
What did we learn today?

1158
04:37:16,020 --> 04:37:18,660
We learned how to browse a project,

1159
04:37:18,660 --> 04:37:20,940
how to create commits and branches.

1160
04:37:20,940 --> 04:37:23,580
And in this episode, we learned how to merge them,

1161
04:37:23,580 --> 04:37:25,420
how to merge two branches together.

1162
04:37:25,420 --> 04:37:27,420
This is the basis of collaboration.

1163
04:37:27,420 --> 04:37:29,740
We will use this a lot on Thursday.

1164
04:37:31,620 --> 04:37:35,140
And it's really useful also for your own work.

1165
04:37:35,140 --> 04:37:40,140
If you want to put something unfinished

1166
04:37:40,140 --> 04:37:43,180
finished or something that you aren't sure about

1167
04:37:43,180 --> 04:37:45,220
on a side branch and not on main.

1168
04:37:46,420 --> 04:37:49,620
But when you are new to Git, it's also fine really

1169
04:37:49,620 --> 04:37:54,540
to start just with one branch, create commits.

1170
04:37:54,540 --> 04:37:58,340
Better to many commits than to few commits.

1171
04:37:58,340 --> 04:37:59,940
They don't have to be beautiful.

1172
04:38:02,580 --> 04:38:04,380
And same with pull requests.

1173
04:38:04,380 --> 04:38:07,940
If I may quickly mention this one question

1174
04:38:07,940 --> 04:38:10,640
which came up in the documents,

1175
04:38:10,640 --> 04:38:13,000
what to do if I have like a pull request

1176
04:38:13,000 --> 04:38:14,800
and I only want to merge half of it.

1177
04:38:15,760 --> 04:38:17,200
I think the best strategy

1178
04:38:17,200 --> 04:38:19,200
is to create many small pull requests

1179
04:38:19,200 --> 04:38:20,320
if you're able to separate it

1180
04:38:20,320 --> 04:38:22,320
so that this situation doesn't arise.

1181
04:38:22,320 --> 04:38:23,700
So in the ideal case,

1182
04:38:23,700 --> 04:38:27,760
you have one pull request for one encapsulated feature

1183
04:38:27,760 --> 04:38:32,220
or one change instead of one huge one.

1184
04:38:33,800 --> 04:38:34,640
Exactly.

1185
04:38:34,640 --> 04:38:37,320
So at the beginning, start using these features.

1186
04:38:37,320 --> 04:38:39,920
then later what is a good practice

1187
04:38:39,920 --> 04:38:42,640
is to not put unrelated things into a commit

1188
04:38:43,560 --> 04:38:46,400
because it is hard to separate unrelated things.

1189
04:38:46,400 --> 04:38:49,640
Also don't put too much into a pull request.

1190
04:38:49,640 --> 04:38:51,480
Not unrelated things into a pull request

1191
04:38:51,480 --> 04:38:53,360
is something I've done here.

1192
04:38:53,360 --> 04:38:58,360
So what if the guacamole recipe change was good

1193
04:38:58,760 --> 04:39:00,960
but my pineapple salad wasn't good?

1194
04:39:00,960 --> 04:39:03,160
So then suddenly it becomes a little bit difficult

1195
04:39:03,160 --> 04:39:04,440
to separate the one from the other.

1196
04:39:04,440 --> 04:39:07,680
So what would it be nicer is to create

1197
04:39:07,680 --> 04:39:12,680
two separate pull requests, which create nice little units.

1198
04:39:14,960 --> 04:39:17,040
A small pull request is easier to review

1199
04:39:17,040 --> 04:39:18,160
than a gigantic one.

1200
04:39:19,080 --> 04:39:21,580
Nobody wants to look through 20,000 lines of code,

1201
04:39:23,360 --> 04:39:26,240
but at the beginning, it's good to use them

1202
04:39:26,240 --> 04:39:27,760
and make it nicer later.

1203
04:39:27,760 --> 04:39:31,680
So don't let the beautiful commits

1204
04:39:31,680 --> 04:39:33,640
and the beautiful pull requests be the enemy

1205
04:39:33,640 --> 04:39:34,800
of just good enough.

1206
04:39:39,280 --> 04:39:42,040
Looking at other questions, we have nine minutes left.

1207
04:39:42,040 --> 04:39:43,120
We want to use it now.

1208
04:39:43,120 --> 04:39:44,320
We can do a little bit more discussion,

1209
04:39:44,320 --> 04:39:46,920
but one thing we should not forget is to,

1210
04:39:46,920 --> 04:39:48,900
we would like to hear feedback from you.

1211
04:39:48,900 --> 04:39:51,800
Maybe somebody can paste our feedback form

1212
04:39:56,280 --> 04:39:57,680
into these documents.

1213
04:39:58,840 --> 04:40:00,120
So what we would like to hear from you

1214
04:40:00,120 --> 04:40:02,140
is what went well today

1215
04:40:02,140 --> 04:40:05,020
then what should we improve today?

1216
04:40:05,020 --> 04:40:08,500
So what should we remove, change, do differently?

1217
04:40:08,500 --> 04:40:09,620
This is very important for us

1218
04:40:09,620 --> 04:40:12,500
because we look at the feedback, we use it.

1219
04:40:12,500 --> 04:40:14,140
If there is something we can improve already

1220
04:40:14,140 --> 04:40:15,500
until tomorrow, we will do.

1221
04:40:22,660 --> 04:40:24,540
And I hear that there is cut visible on the screen

1222
04:40:24,540 --> 04:40:27,140
on the stream and even audible, but I don't hear that.

1223
04:40:27,140 --> 04:40:30,660
So that's too bad for us instructors, Gregor,

1224
04:40:30,660 --> 04:40:33,320
but apparently there are some cut sightings on stream.

1225
04:40:37,240 --> 04:40:39,760
So please, now that I share it, please give us feedback.

1226
04:40:39,760 --> 04:40:40,820
Was it, how did it go?

1227
04:40:40,820 --> 04:40:42,300
Was it too fast, too slow?

1228
04:40:44,440 --> 04:40:47,760
Tell us one good thing about today.

1229
04:40:47,760 --> 04:40:49,120
This feedback is anonymous.

1230
04:40:50,680 --> 04:40:52,520
What was good about today?

1231
04:40:52,520 --> 04:40:55,200
Tell us one thing that we should improve for next time.

1232
04:40:55,200 --> 04:40:57,720
And next time is maybe already tomorrow.

1233
04:40:57,720 --> 04:40:59,160
Any other feedback will come.

1234
04:41:00,660 --> 04:41:05,420
And while the feedback is coming in, I want to look at,

1235
04:41:05,420 --> 04:41:07,080
is there any other question?

1236
04:41:09,140 --> 04:41:12,260
Maybe the one about how exactly are conflicts happening?

1237
04:41:12,260 --> 04:41:16,700
For example, what if we change lines?

1238
04:41:16,700 --> 04:41:18,460
What if the change lines are moved?

1239
04:41:19,620 --> 04:41:21,020
Could be considered different lines

1240
04:41:21,020 --> 04:41:23,020
and therefore different entries,

1241
04:41:23,020 --> 04:41:25,840
even if they are changing the same thing.

1242
04:41:25,840 --> 04:41:26,900
That's an excellent question.

1243
04:41:26,900 --> 04:41:29,020
And Git is really smart about this.

1244
04:41:29,020 --> 04:41:30,780
it doesn't look at blind numbers.

1245
04:41:31,660 --> 04:41:36,080
It uses some really smart algorithms to decide

1246
04:41:36,080 --> 04:41:39,540
which parts are the same thing,

1247
04:41:39,540 --> 04:41:42,300
even as the code evolves,

1248
04:41:42,300 --> 04:41:46,660
even across file renames.

1249
04:41:48,340 --> 04:41:49,480
So it is really smart.

1250
04:41:51,900 --> 04:41:54,780
It is often not a problem.

1251
04:41:54,780 --> 04:41:57,700
You will probably not see it when working just on your own.

1252
04:41:57,700 --> 04:41:59,860
You might see it when collaborating.

1253
04:41:59,860 --> 04:42:03,320
When it happens, it's not a big deal.

1254
04:42:04,620 --> 04:42:06,820
You now know how to resolve it technically.

1255
04:42:07,940 --> 04:42:10,660
We will also on Thursday, when we do collaboration,

1256
04:42:10,660 --> 04:42:12,980
we will discuss on what are good strategies

1257
04:42:12,980 --> 04:42:15,900
so that we can avoid conflicts from even happening.

1258
04:42:18,300 --> 04:42:20,820
And in one sentence, the strategy would be

1259
04:42:20,820 --> 04:42:24,460
keep branches small, keep commits small,

1260
04:42:24,460 --> 04:42:28,160
don't do too many things at the same time,

1261
04:42:28,160 --> 04:42:31,260
then the likelihood that there will be conflicts is smaller.

1262
04:42:37,580 --> 04:42:40,240
We are doing amazing with time, five minutes left, yes.

1263
04:42:40,240 --> 04:42:44,920
Did you comment on how we do very similar things tomorrow,

1264
04:42:44,920 --> 04:42:49,240
but with VS code and command line and locally?

1265
04:42:49,240 --> 04:42:50,720
That's a great prompt here.

1266
04:42:50,720 --> 04:42:53,960
There was a question comment about that.

1267
04:42:54,460 --> 04:42:55,300
That's a great.

1268
04:42:55,300 --> 04:42:57,680
So let's, with everything we did today,

1269
04:42:58,700 --> 04:43:01,080
how will that connect to tomorrow?

1270
04:43:04,500 --> 04:43:07,000
Tomorrow we will learn how to clone a repository

1271
04:43:07,000 --> 04:43:08,140
and work locally.

1272
04:43:08,140 --> 04:43:09,740
Some of you have done it already.

1273
04:43:13,100 --> 04:43:15,020
Tomorrow we will take this recipe,

1274
04:43:15,020 --> 04:43:16,660
make a copy onto our computer

1275
04:43:16,660 --> 04:43:21,660
and learn committing, branching, merging locally.

1276
04:43:21,660 --> 04:43:30,820
Locally, we will, this is possible either in VS code or command line.

1277
04:43:30,820 --> 04:43:34,540
But even if you don't, if the command line doesn't work for you, you don't want to install

1278
04:43:34,540 --> 04:43:37,620
VS code, please still come tomorrow.

1279
04:43:37,620 --> 04:43:41,380
Because the other episode tomorrow will not.

1280
04:43:41,380 --> 04:43:44,900
You can do them only on GitHub if you want to.

1281
04:43:44,900 --> 04:43:52,180
So the second episode will be we will do some of the repository browsing and history inspection

1282
04:43:52,180 --> 04:43:56,300
but a little bit more in depth than today.

1283
04:43:56,300 --> 04:43:59,060
We will study a repository that we don't know.

1284
04:43:59,060 --> 04:44:03,540
It's written by somebody else but we will try to figure a few things out about it.

1285
04:44:03,540 --> 04:44:06,740
This is a very typical situation.

1286
04:44:06,740 --> 04:44:13,060
And then tomorrow the finale will be to turn your own project and it doesn't have to be

1287
04:44:13,060 --> 04:44:15,420
a real project where you don't have to share your project

1288
04:44:15,420 --> 04:44:16,340
that you have on a computer,

1289
04:44:16,340 --> 04:44:20,380
but we will create your own example project,

1290
04:44:20,380 --> 04:44:24,460
but learn how to turn it, make it a Git repository

1291
04:44:24,460 --> 04:44:28,780
and how to share it on GitHub or GitLab.

1292
04:44:28,780 --> 04:44:30,980
And what would be the next steps

1293
04:44:30,980 --> 04:44:34,620
if you want to make your project citable.

1294
04:44:36,260 --> 04:44:37,940
So these are the goal for tomorrow.

1295
04:44:37,940 --> 04:44:40,820
We will then tomorrow also talk a bit more about the balance.

1296
04:44:40,820 --> 04:44:50,820
what is a good balance when you start using it, of where to start, how to progress,

1297
04:44:50,820 --> 04:44:55,300
and what are typical things, typical problems that you want to avoid?

1298
04:44:56,180 --> 04:45:00,820
Of course, you're already welcome to browse these, and then tomorrow come with lots of questions.

1299
04:45:00,820 --> 04:45:12,820
questions. So, if someone has tried the VS code track today. Are there is tomorrow something

1300
04:45:12,820 --> 04:45:24,220
different than today. Do you learn new things. Yes, there will be. So, if you have done this

1301
04:45:24,220 --> 04:45:28,900
already today then the first episode, there will be some repetition but I think it doesn't

1302
04:45:28,900 --> 04:45:33,520
harm, to get it a little bit more into our muscle memory, there will be something new

1303
04:45:33,520 --> 04:45:40,700
and that is, we will take a closer look at what is the difference between a local branch

1304
04:45:40,700 --> 04:45:46,900
and a remote branch. And we got a few questions about it today, we didn't really talk about

1305
04:45:46,900 --> 04:45:54,220
it by design, but tomorrow we will hopefully give an understanding that you see the difference

1306
04:45:54,220 --> 04:45:58,120
between what is a local branch and remote branch. This is something that confused me

1307
04:45:58,120 --> 04:46:04,400
a lot when I started using it. So that will be different already in episode one.

1308
04:46:04,400 --> 04:46:13,020
Yes. Okay. And if someone starts from tomorrow and hasn't been here today, I guess that works

1309
04:46:13,020 --> 04:46:18,400
fine. Also, that's fine. No problem. Invite your friends and so on.

1310
04:46:18,400 --> 04:46:23,000
Exactly. So even if, or even if you were here today and everything failed, and I don't know

1311
04:46:23,000 --> 04:46:29,000
you don't find the repositories again, please come tomorrow. You don't need to have the things

1312
04:46:29,000 --> 04:46:37,080
from today for the tomorrow's exercises. We invite your friends. It's really fine and welcome to

1313
04:46:37,800 --> 04:46:39,800
join just for a day or just for an episode.

1314
04:46:42,840 --> 04:46:47,240
And thanks a lot for the feedback. One thing that was really good and one thing to improve.

1315
04:46:47,240 --> 04:46:55,240
Yeah, and we should thank Radovan for this latest lesson redesigned.

1316
04:46:55,240 --> 04:46:56,240
And Richard.

1317
04:46:56,240 --> 04:47:01,240
Well, yeah, but I was gone on the weekend when Radovan was working on it.

1318
04:47:01,240 --> 04:47:14,240
But anyway, it was a great effort to rewrite it this new way that introduces it with GitHub as the main flow, main path, and the other things there.

1319
04:47:14,240 --> 04:47:15,400
there.

1320
04:47:15,400 --> 04:47:19,120
So we're really looking forward to see

1321
04:47:19,120 --> 04:47:21,600
how this goes for future days.

1322
04:47:21,600 --> 04:47:24,000
And you can all help us contributing.

1323
04:47:24,000 --> 04:47:26,800
We know that there are some rough edges.

1324
04:47:26,800 --> 04:47:29,160
If you go into the Git history of the lesson,

1325
04:47:29,160 --> 04:47:32,040
you will see that there has been some weekend work

1326
04:47:32,040 --> 04:47:35,560
and late changes.

1327
04:47:35,560 --> 04:47:38,040
So this will evolve as we go.

1328
04:47:38,040 --> 04:47:39,440
But now, I mean, in this workshop,

1329
04:47:39,440 --> 04:47:43,000
we learn how to contribute to other people's projects

1330
04:47:43,000 --> 04:47:50,000
and your contributions and issues and ideas are really what makes this go.

1331
04:47:50,000 --> 04:48:01,160
Yeah, so I guess there's no new questions. So, you can expect videos to be processed

1332
04:48:01,160 --> 04:48:11,240
by later this evening.

1333
04:48:11,240 --> 04:48:17,040
If you want to be more involved, consider joining the Code Refinery chat and asking

1334
04:48:17,040 --> 04:48:18,200
what you can do.

1335
04:48:18,200 --> 04:48:22,000
We've got different stuff that people can look at.

1336
04:48:22,000 --> 04:48:27,800
Anyway, yeah, anything else or?

1337
04:48:27,800 --> 04:48:31,440
Yeah, we need more cats tomorrow.

1338
04:48:31,440 --> 04:48:34,240
So that's a clear takeaway here from the feedback.

1339
04:48:34,240 --> 04:48:35,240
But I think I'm happy.

1340
04:48:35,240 --> 04:48:38,240
I don't know, Gego, did we forget something?

1341
04:48:38,240 --> 04:48:46,920
No, I think we went through most of the important things that we were planning to go for anyway.

1342
04:48:46,920 --> 04:48:50,640
We can go through the documents today in the afternoon and see whether we missed anything

1343
04:48:50,640 --> 04:48:56,520
and maybe, if there is time, we can discuss it tomorrow.

1344
04:48:56,520 --> 04:48:57,520
Thanks so much, Gregor.

1345
04:48:57,520 --> 04:48:59,840
I'm looking forward to teach with you again then on Thursday.

1346
04:48:59,840 --> 04:49:03,080
Tomorrow we will be with Björn.

1347
04:49:03,080 --> 04:49:05,960
Really looking forward to it.

1348
04:49:05,960 --> 04:49:06,960
Thanks everybody.

1349
04:49:06,960 --> 04:49:16,800
to all the people answering questions, working in local rooms. Thanks to Samantha for the

1350
04:49:16,800 --> 04:49:21,320
intro. There are lots of people who make this happen. Have a nice afternoon. See you all

1351
04:49:21,320 --> 04:49:22,320
tomorrow.

1352
04:49:22,320 --> 04:49:25,800
OK, thanks so much.

1353
04:49:25,800 --> 04:49:26,800
Bye.

1354
04:49:26,800 --> 04:49:27,300
Bye.

1355
04:49:27,300 --> 04:49:28,140
Bye bye.
