2.2 Pandas 2/2 - Python for Scientific Computing 2023

Pandas is the standard tabular data package for Python.  It allows you to do plenty of operations quickly and seamlessly.  In this lesson, we go over the basics of using Pandas.  After this lesson, you won't know everything but you will be able to read the docs and figure out from more yourself, which is what almost everyone has to do anyway.

Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a basic to intermediate course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools, such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python and want to know some internals and important libraries for science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.

This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific Computing.
