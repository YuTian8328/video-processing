1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
I can hear us on the stream, which I will now mute because the echo is, of course, annoying.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,380
So we put two icebreakers in here.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,680
What's the most surprising thing you've learned so far in this course and most surprising

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,980
thing you've learned so far in your career?

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:22,060
And if anyone has any other icebreaker ideas, please, well, you can also propose your own

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:28,940
questions there.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:36,300
I'm trying to think of something specifically related to today's materials, which is a bit,

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,300
we have a wide range of topics.

9
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:54,980
Yeah, so what's our summary so far?

10
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,580
Where have we come from and where did we go?

11
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:07,380
We started with day 1, and it seemed like it was pretty normal Python stuff.

12
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,520
Like Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, I mean, doing Python code.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,500
Day 2 did we start getting exciting.

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,020
So day 2 started pretty normal with Pandas and Matplotlib.

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:35,500
again using normal Python code. Towards the end, we start seeing more interactions with the rest

16
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,300
of the world. So the data formats emphasizing how it's not just about the code, but how you

17
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:54,700
mess with this other, how you read and write data outside of Python can matter.

18
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,020
And then, of course, the things like the linters and so on, which is user interface.

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,340
But then yesterday, I mean, yesterday's the kind of stuff which is really important for

20
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,980
using Python, but you wouldn't see in a typical course.

21
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:20,180
So things like making the scripts, well, you might see that in a Python course, not a purely

22
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,420
theoretical programming course.

23
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,460
But yeah, the introduction to programming with Python

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,700
might not even use Jupyter.

25
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,180
It might use just scripts.

26
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,860
And the library ecosystem independency management,

27
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:46,500
well, that is, I mean, that's really

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,180
getting to the kind of stuff which we use

29
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,460
and we support people with on a daily basis.

30
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,740
So my estimate has been that about half of our

31
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:02,460
total support requests are helping to install software on the cluster,

32
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:09,180
a lot of which is in Python and could, in theory, be done independently.

33
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,060
But it's so confusing and hard.

34
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,940
Dependencies are a complicated topic and a big unsolved problem.

35
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,960
Um, it's also the reason, like all of these libraries, the fact that they

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,780
exist is the reason why Python is good.

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,820
I mean, the language itself is good, but the main reason people actually use it

38
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,300
is because there are already all of these libraries available.

39
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,280
Hello from my side as well.

40
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,740
Yeah.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,140
Like I was just thinking myself at that, like, uh, quite often when, when using

42
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,060
Python, it's more about reading what some other person has done like a package and then reading

43
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:00,500
how they want you to use it and then just using it. And it's like, is this, can you call this

44
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,620
even like coding when you're like calling functions from other libraries and that sort of

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:13,940
stuff? But of course you are coding, but like, yeah. And, and, and, and using, using like, it

46
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:21,380
would be wasteful to not use the capabilities provided by the other people.

47
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,300
And it's usually the thing you find is not exactly the thing you want, but you can

48
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,300
coax your data to fit into that and kind of use it or modify it slightly to make it what you want.

49
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:43,140
Yeah. And it's like buying Lego blocks. You buy Lego blocks and then you have a world that you can

50
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,500
create with them and you can of course like just follow the instructions and do the set that you

51
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:56,580
have bought or whatever or you can go wild and do whatever you want with them like combine the blocks

52
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,020
in an unexpected way and create something new and that's what like usually happens but you don't

53
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,060
start molding the lego blocks yourself like that would be waste of time like getting like a 3d

54
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:15,380
printer to mold them. Of course, if you want to, you can go to Python libraries and start

55
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,700
writing C code and that sort of stuff, but then you're coding C code and you're not coding Python.

56
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:30,020
So I think we need to do a volume check.

57
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:37,980
So, well, let's start with an order, me, [name], [name].

58
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,980
1.

59
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,980
1.

60
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
1.

61
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
2.

62
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
2.

63
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
2.

64
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
3.

65
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
3.

66
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
3.

67
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
Three.

68
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Three.

69
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,420
So, I think [name] is too loud.

70
00:05:52,420 --> 00:06:00,700
I can also drop it here.

71
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,060
I'm actually not at 100%.

72
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,900
Is it better now?

73
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,020
You still seem pretty loud.

74
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,020
Better?

75
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,020
One.

76
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,020
Two.

77
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Sorry.

78
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
Oh, yeah.

79
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
One, one, one.

80
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,020
Two.

81
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
Two.

82
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
Okay.

83
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,020
Is this better?

84
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Okay.

85
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:33,020
Might be just my enthusiasm rubbing off on you.

86
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
Yeah.

87
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,020
Might be just my enthusiasm rubbing off.

88
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,300
Yeah.

89
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,180
So I'm liking these icebreaker answers here.

90
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,140
I just thought of these last minute,

91
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,420
but it's good to see what's surprising in the course.

92
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,580
And also, I like these career lessons also.

93
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:11,040
So, last time there were some problems with a blurry screen, and one part might have been

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:19,880
Twitch, but also it might have been so people are sharing by Zoom, and then I render it

95
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:28,480
on the screen, and then capture it, and then it gets rebroadcasted.

96
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,840
So there might be a little bit of blur that comes here.

97
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:40,480
So if you see a problem, let me know, is it really bad or like a little bit of anti-aliasing

98
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,720
around the letters and let us know right away and we'll try to fix that.

99
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
Yeah.

100
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,160
On your side, I recommend in the Twitch, there's like this cog icon at the bottom right of

101
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:59,080
video where you can click the video quality and you can make it to appear as source quality,

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,560
because otherwise it's automatic and then it might degrade it based on the network performance that

103
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,280
you have. So you might like get suddenly a blurry flash because it's buffering or something like

104
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:19,240
that. So setting it to force it to be the highest quality might mitigate some of the problems.

105
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:30,560
Okay. Well, it's 10.01. Any comments from these surprising things or should we just

106
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,800
go on? Should us instructors say the most surprising stuff? Maybe we should just go

107
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,400
on. We can answer this in the panel discussion.

108
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Okay.

109
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,480
In the wheel getting reinvented. But yeah, we'll talk about it. Well, at least we will

110
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,080
talk about how to package your own stuff so that other people

111
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,120
don't need to necessarily write it themselves later.

112
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,640
But first, we have some parallel processing.

113
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,600
OK, so I'll head out.

114
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,800
Can you share the screen?

115
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,680
Yeah, I can take the share if you capture it from my screen.

116
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Okay.

117
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,480
I see it.

118
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Okay.

119
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Okay.

120
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
I will head off.

121
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
All right.

122
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,000
See you.
