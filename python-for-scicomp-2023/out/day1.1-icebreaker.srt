1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
the 10 minutes of icebreaker time, so we're just here to chat while we're getting ready.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:12,100
So my name is [name]. I'm here to, well, I'm one of the instructors and organizers

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:19,100
of the course. And with me here, would you all like to introduce yourselves? So [name]

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,460
is next on my screen.

5
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,060
Did [name]'s internet.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:30,900
Oh, there.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,720
Hello.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,560
Hello.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,940
Sorry, I was just switching to a wired connection.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,780
Good idea.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,900
So hello, I'm [name].

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,980
I'm also one of the instructors

13
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,820
and a research software engineer at Aalto University.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:54,580
Hi, I'm [name]. I'm an application expert at UPPMAX, Uppsala University in Sweden,

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:00,460
and I will also be teaching during this workshop. Hi, everyone.

16
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:07,460
Okay, so what I'm screen-sharing here is what we call the notes.

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,460
So, right here.

18
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,460
You can't see the cursor.

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,460
So, this is only for registered participants.

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:31,060
So if you would, if you're watching and you're not registered, if you register, I think you'll get an auto-reply that has this information here.

21
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:45,860
So how does it work? So at the top it has all the important links, and down below we see, well it's like Google Docs, so it's a collaborative writing thing.

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:55,620
So, I think the microphones might be wrong here.

23
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,620
[name] or [name], can you say something?

24
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,620
Hello, one, two, three.

25
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,620
One, two.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:11,620
Okay. It seems... Oh, wait.

27
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:22,220
Okay, now I think it's better. Yeah. I know what the problem was. If there was an echo,

28
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,540
that was me.

29
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,340
So there's a question in Twitch chat which is asking, is this recorded? So the answer

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:39,300
is yes. So Twitch has the videos available immediately. And on YouTube, by the same night,

31
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,820
it should already be there.

32
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,580
And we can talk about the video processing later.

33
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,580
But OK, so back to the notes that we're talking about.

34
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,500
So if you go to the top, you can switch to an edit mode,

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,540
and then back to view mode.

36
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,660
You can even do the split mode.

37
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,540
But we used this like a chat.

38
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,620
So any time you would be asking something in a chat,

39
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,180
instead come here and write it somewhere. So you see at the bottom there's a Q&A part,

40
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,060
so someone could demonstrate writing the question. Let's practice writing the question.

41
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,340
Is this recorded?

42
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,500
And then we have a whole bunch of people who are also course instructors, and we're watching and

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,700
and answering it in real time.

44
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,580
So it's like a synchronous parallel chat Q&A kind

45
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,980
of thing.

46
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,420
So with this, we can have so many different questions

47
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,860
and answers at the same time and actually keep track of it.

48
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,500
And then we can archive it later.

49
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
But for now, we have icebreakers.

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,340
So if you scroll up, you see some questions

51
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,980
from registrations and so on, but then down here

52
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,500
to icebreaker questions.

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:15,620
So everyone that's registered, please take this, open it,

54
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,900
and scroll down to this point, and write down where

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,020
or write down the answers to the questions.

56
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,060
And let's see.

57
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,860
So you can also answer plus one for anything

58
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,300
that you're agreeing with.

59
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,860
And this is also a common thing.

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,340
So if you see something that you'd especially like answered

61
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
or you agree with, you can plus one it.

62
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,580
So where's everyone?

63
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,060
Where are we from?

64
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,300
So right now, I'm from a small office

65
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,940
at Aalto University in Finland.

66
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,820
And I guess [name] is teaching from home today?

67
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,140
Yeah, from somewhere in Espoo, Finland.

68
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,780
Yeah, and I'm in my office in Uppsala.

69
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,280
Yeah.

70
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,820
Oh, OK.

71
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:27,100
So we see a big variety of people from mostly European

72
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,180
countries, but not only.

73
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,820
So that's good.

74
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,100
We're glad that people can join us from all over.

75
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,460
And how much do people use Python?

76
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,180
Fair amount, quite a bit.

77
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,900
How much have the instructors used Python?

78
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,860
So, I don't know, what was your intro to Python and how long have you been using it?

79
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,860
I don't remember.

80
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,460
Which is, I guess, for a long time.

81
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,160
Yeah.

82
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,900
So, at least six, seven years ago.

83
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,660
So, I don't remember the first thing I did with Python.

84
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,140
But yeah, I do most things with Python these days.

85
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,640
Okay.

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,120
And before Python, what did you use?

87
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,280
C, C++ mostly, so I was doing very different kinds of things, so those were appropriate

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,840
languages for what I was doing, yeah.

89
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
And [name]?

90
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:39,520
Yeah, I had started with C, some C++ and Fortran, and it's mostly during the, I don't know,

91
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,360
maybe five years, past five years

92
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,640
that I've been using Python.

93
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,520
OK, yeah.

94
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,000
And as for me, I remember, so at first, I

95
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,760
was doing some stuff in C. And I had this friend saying

96
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,680
I needed to learn Python some.

97
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,400
But I didn't for a while until I did.

98
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,360
And well, I've been using it as my main language.

99
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,480
ever since.

100
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,920
So yeah.

101
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,640
And let's see.

102
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,800
So our audience here, how much have we used Python?

103
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
Yeah.

104
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
So I'd say this whole course, it's

105
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,120
designed for people that know a little bit about Python,

106
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,040
like the basic programming, but not the details

107
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,640
of using it for science.

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,560
And we're especially going into these libraries.

109
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,680
But if you're more advanced than that,

110
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,280
you'll probably still learn some tricks,

111
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,240
although the first few days may be a bit slow.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,000
Just come back for the later days.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,440
And if you haven't done any Python at all,

114
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,080
well, we're not covering that.

115
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,760
But by watching, you'll probably learn about, well,

116
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,880
learn some good things to help when you do start using Python.

117
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,200
OK, using Jupyter before, almost nothing.

118
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,840
So Jupyter is something that we talk a little bit more about.

119
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,400
And I believe, who's the first instructors here

120
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,000
for the Jupyter part?

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,760
It's me and [name].

122
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,640
OK, yeah, so Jarna and [name] will talk about that.

123
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
Oh, these JupyterLab extensions.

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,400
So maybe I should give some background on why we ask this question.

125
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:44,400
So some of our participants are working on hearing what those are, but we won't really

126
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,360
have time during the course.

127
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
And it's also great to hear from you all.

128
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,360
But if you do not know what those are, don't worry.

129
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Yeah.

130
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Okay.

131
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,760
So it's time to start the main part.

132
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,000
I saw a comment in chat that our audio might not be balanced.
