1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,600
This is the course web page.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,680
And if you scroll down, you find the schedule.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,440
And right now, here we are at intro.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
So I open that.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,520
So hi, welcome to Python for Scientific Computing.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,800
So we've already introduced ourselves

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,760
in the little icebreaker session.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,120
So let's go right past that.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,480
Maybe we can talk about our organization some.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,560
So [name] and I work at Aalto University in Finland.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,560
And [name], who, what, where do you work right now?

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm working at Uppsala University in Sweden.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,160
Yes.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,640
And as you may have noticed from the webpage,

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,700
there's a lot of different partners here.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,260
So we have instructors from Finland, Norway, and Sweden,

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,860
at least.

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,500
And people all around have been advertising the course.

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,860
So the basic course contents.

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,860
So day one starts off with some basic tools.

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,220
So if you've used Python for science a little bit,

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,820
you probably know these.

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,660
But we have to cover them to make

24
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,020
sure everyone's on the same page and has a good foundation.

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,660
On day two, it's still fairly basic,

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,800
but we start going to more interesting things,

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,540
such as the visualization and data formats.

28
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,300
And then days three and four gets

29
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,660
to even more specialized tools, which,

30
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,460
unless you've done a lot of stuff,

31
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,140
this is probably still new to you.

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,220
And we can adjust the schedule as needed.

33
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,740
So what you see on the website might be adjusted some.

34
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,940
Also, on the last day, we have this panel discussion.

35
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,420
And in the panel discussion,

36
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,100
we have all the instructors together

37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,140
and you can ask us any questions.

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,700
And that's usually a lot of fun.

39
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,180
Okay, so how to attend.

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,980
So obviously you figured out this is a live stream.

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,060
So you're watching on Twitch.

42
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,640
You're free to share the link

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,720
to anyone you may want in the world.

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,480
That's completely fine and intended.

45
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,880
But there can be different pathways beyond that.

46
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,000
So some people will pay close attention,

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
do all the exercises, try to learn everything.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,720
Other people may watch,

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,040
you may follow along with some of the examples and solutions,

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
but you might be a little bit less active.

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,360
Some people might be watching passively,

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,200
seeing what's there, and then come back

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,000
later whenever it becomes more relevant to you.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,280
These are all OK ways of attending.

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
And we support them all.

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
Practicalities.

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,160
So live streaming is different.

58
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,080
So whenever we would do these workshops in person,

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,400
we might have a few tens of people there.

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,160
Right now, according to my Twitch description,

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,800
there's 209 people following us.

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,360
And there are more than 400 people registered.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
So how does this work?

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
So we're like a TV production, something like that.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,280
Anyone can watch.

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,200
There's pauses for exercises, like considerate,

67
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,400
like commercial breaks or something like that.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,080
And we will say, OK, now it's time for an exercise.

69
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,640
We mute the stream.

70
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,840
Us instructors come and plan what

71
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,600
to do next in the background.

72
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,040
And then you have time to work on things.

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,240
We keep watching the notes and let's see.

74
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
So we watch the notes.

75
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,320
answer questions there during the exercises and we come back and based on what the questions were

76
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:50,160
and what people are interested in, we can go over the exercises and the solutions or go straight on.

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:03,280
In some places there may be other in-person or online meetings where people are working together.

78
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,200
For example, some people might be

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
with their friends in a conference room.

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
You're watching together, and during the breaks

81
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,960
you're working there.

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,640
This is also completely fine, and actually we'd recommend it.

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,920
So some years we've organized these Zoom sessions ourselves,

84
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,480
but this time it's all on our partners to organize those.

85
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,520
Within the workshop, we have different parts.

86
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,600
So we have the part where we're talking, the live stream.

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,400
we have type along where we're typing and you can try to type along with us. There's exercises.

88
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,480
So this is where you do your own thing. And then we have breaks. So at least 10 minutes per hour,

89
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:56,040
sometime between the 50 and the 10 of the hour. Chat and communication. So some of us are

90
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,160
watching the Twitch chat, but it's not where you recommend the questions go because we can't follow

91
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:10,360
it. Instead, we recommend that you ask an answer in the notes document, which you get if you

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:18,280
register. It's the benefit for registering. So like this, so this is from a different course,

93
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,200
but you see there's sections, there's things, people ask questions in bullet points, and answer

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,760
in other bullet points. And we have people that are always watching this, so you'll usually get

95
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,920
an answer very quickly. Always write at the very bottom because that's the only part we're

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:46,120
actively monitoring. Every so often we copy all the old questions away and put them in an archive

97
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,840
notes document and that's findable from the top. You can also use this to figure out where we are

98
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,680
are in the lesson.

99
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,480
We update the section, stuff like that.

100
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,860
Yeah, here's the way you switch between view and edit modes

101
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,640
and so on.

102
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Yeah.

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,080
So one thing or two things to be aware of.

104
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,360
So there's going to be a lot of stuff written here,

105
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,080
so don't get overloaded.

106
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,800
So the point is that you can come back and follow this later.

107
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,680
So during the course, I'd recommend if you're bored,

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,320
look at it.

109
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,080
you're actively focusing on what we're saying, focus on that and leave the notes alone. And also,

110
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,560
please never include any identifiers or names or things in the notes because it's archived and

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:42,200
anyone may see it. So from the course website, you can find these forever. They're not going away.

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,800
So if you haven't done it yet, please open the notes and answer the icebreaker there.

113
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,240
there. We've already been doing that some, but now really do it.

114
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Okay, screen arrangement. So you may notice we're broadcasting in this weird little vertical

115
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,320
arrangement. There's a very specific reason for this. So you can arrange the screen like

116
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,760
this, where Twitch with the vertical arrangement is taking half, and the other half is for

117
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,600
you. So you can have the lesson and notes in the web browser, your workspace where you're

118
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,720
doing work. I guess in this case, your workspace might be a Jupyter, JupyterLab or something

119
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:38,240
like that. Whatever the case. And yes. And we found this works pretty well, even for

120
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,140
small screens. Okay. I've already talked a little bit about this, but just to emphasize.

121
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:51,300
So we recommend first you focus on the screen sharing lecture when we're talking.

122
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,940
And that's your first priority.

123
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,200
Then is your own type of longer exercises.

124
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,620
And then only after that, you focus on the notes, your own exercise group if you have

125
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,440
one, and the lesson webpage.

126
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,220
And we have plenty of breaks where you can follow up and catch up later.

127
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,820
I mean, everything we say is written down somewhere,

128
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,980
so you're not really losing information.

129
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,860
This year, we don't have the Zoom,

130
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,340
but we will explicitly tell you when you go to exercises,

131
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,460
and when you come back to the main lecture.

132
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,060
If you're trying to work like that,

133
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,900
you don't have any worries.

134
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,060
What can go wrong, or should I say will go wrong?

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,900
Some of these variation will always be,

136
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,700
will happen in every one of our courses.

137
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,020
So for some people, the lessons are too simple.

138
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,620
So it's OK.

139
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,220
The later lessons will become interesting.

140
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,620
You're in your home or office or wherever,

141
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,020
so just do something else and listen passively.

142
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,100
The lessons are too advanced.

143
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,380
Well, you can keep watching passively

144
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,860
and learn and come back later.

145
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,660
All our material is open and will stay open forever.

146
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:10,660
However, if the instructors make a mistake, well, actually, that's by design.

147
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,720
So you'll learn by seeing when things don't work and how we debug it.

148
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,560
If the nodes stop responding.

149
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,480
So if we have 200 people editing this document at the same time, it might get a little bit

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
slow.

151
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:32,080
So in that case, people will wait a little bit and hopefully it will pass.

152
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,960
also keep trying to keep it short to avoid this by moving to the archive notes. And you can find

153
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,800
that link at the top. If the stream dies. So if the computer I'm on, well, if one of them dies,

154
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:51,120
then all the broadcasting gets lost. And in that case, well, you'll get a message from Twitch.

155
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,280
So just wait around some, I'll restart everything, and we'll get back as soon as we can.

156
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,720
It's happened only very rarely, but be aware.

157
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,800
Internet dies. Actually, during one of our courses,

158
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,560
the Fastly CDN had a problem,

159
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
and then people couldn't rejoin the stream,

160
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
and that was lots of fun.

161
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,880
But in that case, just wait around and we'll be back eventually.

162
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,840
Oh wait, this isn't a problem.

163
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,280
So if I was at home,

164
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,040
which hopefully I will be,

165
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,360
my cat might come and visit us,

166
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,520
and that's always one of the joys of the workshop.

167
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,520
So, hang around and maybe you get to see us get distracted that way.

168
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,080
Okay, videos.

169
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,020
So yes, it is recorded.

170
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,360
Twitch saves them for seven days directly there, the raw video, and usually on YouTube

171
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,040
by the same night, we have them processed and released.

172
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,320
If you want to follow this process or help us, please get in touch.

173
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Okay.

174
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,340
It should be respectful and helpful to everyone.

175
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,340
So here's four main pieces of advice, and you probably heard more later.

176
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,780
But be aware, everyone here is at different levels, and that's just expected.

177
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,500
So people focus on different things.

178
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,260
Passive learning is okay, so be kind to each other.

179
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,100
Everyone is both a teacher and a learner, even us.

180
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,220
So I think all of us, when preparing for this course, we've learned a few new things about

181
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,100
the different stuff we're teaching.

182
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,980
As a learner yourself,

183
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,020
you're a teacher to other people you're interacting with.

184
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,020
Yes, keep this in mind.

185
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,140
Take the time to check it.

186
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,540
Ask the other people you're with,

187
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,860
and we'll be asking you, how's it going?

188
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,980
Are you able to follow?

189
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,460
Do you need us to go faster or slower?

190
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,220
Then finally, when something isn't right,

191
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,540
let us know immediately.

192
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:56,620
So the classic case here is that the sound is too low,

193
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,900
or you can't see the screen, or I've

194
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
forgotten to adjust the broadcast

195
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,940
to include what's needed.

196
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,340
Write in the notes or Twitch chat or somewhere immediately,

197
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,580
and we'll see, even if you think it's

198
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,740
only a minor inconvenience, like our audio is imbalanced.

199
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,780
OK, final notes.

200
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,420
So we have information on credits on the web page.

201
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,900
You can read it there as much as you want.

202
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,260
You can keep in touch with us these ways.

203
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,220
We're always happy to have new people taking part,

204
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,580
especially if you would like to co-teach or become

205
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,700
a partner in this workshop later.

206
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,260
So basically advertise and run own workshop sessions.

207
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,860
This date is not out of date, but we

208
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,540
have other workshops which are going on.

209
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,260
We recommend you sign up for the Code Refinery newsletter

210
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,060
to get those announcements.

211
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,140
And Code Refinery, that newsletter

212
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,380
is findable from here.

213
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,000
OK, that's all.
