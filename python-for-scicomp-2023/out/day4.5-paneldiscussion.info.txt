4.5 Panel discussion - Python for Scientific Computing 2023

At the end of the course, we had a general panel discussion/Q&A session with all of these instructions.  We discuss many interesting topics.

See the notes for all the questions asked, which are findable by the course page: https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/python-for-scicomp-2023/

-----

Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a basic to intermediate course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools, such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python and want to know some internals and important libraries for science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.

This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific Computing.
