1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,280
Should I do a little bit of wrap up of the course?

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,520
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,280
So there's an outro linked from the web page,

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,880
but it's not very up to date.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,080
Maybe I'll share it anyway.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,120
There, this is my screen.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:37,040
So, there's many people that have helped made this part, not just the instructors, but others, and you can see the credits on the web page.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:53,040
So, about organizations. Code Refinery is a publicly funded project by the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration, which supports computational research, teaching, and software tools.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,200
Our organization at Aalto University supports computational research here,

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,880
and a lot of the other instructors you saw from other institutions, they're very similar to us.

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,040
So basically, the idea is, like oftentimes in academia, you think, okay, I need to learn

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,960
everything myself. But in the real world, it's good to have other people you can work with as a team.

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,320
And if you don't have these kinds of computational experts

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,480
in your own group, you can come to people like us

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,440
and ask for help and advice.

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,400
So wherever you are, I'd recommend

17
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,000
you finding if there's these type of people there.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,440
There are other future events.

19
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,080
So this is not updated since last year.

20
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,480
But actually, if you update the years,

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,800
it's actually pretty accurate.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,480
So Code Refinery is a workshop on, basically,

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,160
version control and other software development practices.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,440
So not about Python, but it's taught like this

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,400
and really good to take also.

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,160
Workflows course, this is written

27
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,120
we wanted to give it in 2022, and then we

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,760
wanted to give it in 2023, and we still haven't given it.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,680
But maybe we should get on that.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,040
I'm not sure if high performance data analysis will

31
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,440
be taught again.

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,560
And then also in June of 2023, in our university,

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,200
we have a course which is a kickstart

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
to scientific computing and high-performance computing.

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,520
And these courses, Code Refinery and this one,

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
are all taught just like we are here,

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,240
with the livestream format, code teaching,

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,640
and basically should be of this quality.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,400
For announcements for many of these things,

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,600
subscribe to a Code Refinery newsletter. How to stay in touch? Well, you can find some social

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,280
media here. If you think that the kind of things we're talking about are what you're interested in,

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:06,920
possibly more interesting than the scientific side of things you do, or you like the science

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,840
but you also like the software more than you can do there, a research software engineer is the name

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,880
of the kind of people we are. So we do research, we do software, and we connect them.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,000
If you would like to meet with more like-minded people like this, there's research software

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,640
engineer associations, which are of the people like us. In Nordics there is this one, but you

47
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,960
can find more in other places. Are there things to talk about working together?

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,160
So in the future,

49
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,320
these are some ideas for what to do.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,880
Basically, you can join

51
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,800
the Code Refinery organization and

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,120
help us to put on courses like this.

53
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,980
So we really think we have

54
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,140
a pretty good teaching style here.

55
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,840
That's both accessible to a very large audience.

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,760
It's our information is reusable

57
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
since we have the videos and all of that.

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,720
It's also very interactive and fun to listen to.

59
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,040
If you would like to support this kind of thing,

60
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,720
please get in touch,

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,560
join Code Refinery, and at the very least,

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,040
tell people that we have this good way of teaching,

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
so we can try to spread it to other people.

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,700
With that being said, in the past,

65
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,800
we've had an after-party in Zoom,

66
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,200
So we would share the Zoom link that we are in right now

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,920
and allow everyone in the audience to join.

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,480
So I won't give it yet, but it's a possibility.

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,840
Should we put the feedback for today?

70
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Oh, yes.

71
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,640
I forgot that.

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:13,160
And I will also send you a feedback, a more general anonymous feedback for the whole course

73
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,240
so that you could tell, for example, you know, what worked best, what needs improving or

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,680
what was missing.

75
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,640
And I was writing something in the notes that I forgot.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,600
Oh yeah, that we also have a form where you can request future courses.

77
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:43,760
So I'm now I'm going to paste it there on it's coming so that you know if there is enough

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:55,220
volume of requests we can do all sorts of things I have to say that many of you when

79
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,820
you register, maybe 75% actually tick the box, please let me know about future courses.

80
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,500
So you will definitely receive more emails from me. And of course, you can always unsubscribe

81
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:17,100
Please give feedback if you hear this is important.

82
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,740
Is there any more?

83
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,660
Or should we call it the end?

84
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,260
Maybe we should call it the day and let people

85
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,340
join the Zoom after the streaming is over.

86
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,840
Yes.

87
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,340
Thank you, everyone.

88
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,540
Thank you to all.

89
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,060
You were a great audience.

90
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:12,580
And I think this was one of the best courses we've put on yet.

91
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,740
So thank you.

92
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,240
Bye.

93
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,740
Bye.

94
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,240
Bye.

95
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,780
Bye.
