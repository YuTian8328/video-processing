3.5 Binder - Python for Scientific Computing 2023

A demo of the Binder service.

Binder (mybinder.org) is a cloud service for running Jupyter in a reproducible software environment.  It uses requirements files in various languages (requirements.txt, environment.yml, and similar for other languages) to create an environment out of a repository (Github, Gitlab, Zenodo).

Python for Scientific Computing is a bridge between basic Python courses and scientific work with Python.  This is a basic to intermediate course in Python tools such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.  It also covers some more advanced tools, such as Binder, releasing software, data formats, etc.  It is suitable for people who have a basic understanding of Python and want to know some internals and important libraries for science.  We don't cover anything in too much depth, but we do introduce you to all of the main tools you will need.

This course was put on as a collaboration between partners in Finland, Norway, and Sweden, coordinated by Aalto Scientific Computing.
