1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Yeah, I agree that is very likely the case. Yep.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Switched back here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,960
So, what's the summary of today? So, this course, the started alph on days one and two,

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:21,880
which is just about using Python. And that works in JupyterLab in the cloud wherever.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,640
But as we're going on we're moving further and further towards how Python interacts with the

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,840
operating system itself. So basically we're seeing how you would break out of the Jupyter notebooks

7
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:43,960
and be able to run these other, like run things on your computer, run it without Jupyter, run it

8
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,880
more times, be able to share your code, things like this. And these are the kind of things which

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,160
are needed to go to the next level. So someone, like there is plenty of work that can be done

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:06,520
only within the Jupyter web interface, but many of you probably need to at least know of these

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,600
concepts of how to go out, even if it's someone else you're working with that's managing these

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:24,600
kinds of things. So there's feedback which is coming here. Please answer. I see right now

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,160
there's 86 people who are still on the stream and this is not many answers. So please vote

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,040
for what you think.

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:50,040
Okay. So the news for tomorrow. So there's one lesson tomorrow which uses the command line

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,880
and it's actually about packaging. So it's basically how you can make

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:01,960
a package which can itself go on the pip or conda repositories and then other people can use it.

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,960
But it doesn't have to go that far. I oftentimes make things into packages but I install it

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,000
directly from github because the use isn't really that much and I'm just using it internally myself.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,720
So, the topics are more advanced, but also you can do things, there's the first lesson

21
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,920
can be done only through JupyterLab and the third one.

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:39,440
So these have good exercises which other people can do also.

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:48,220
Also at the end, we have a panel discussion where you can basically ask all of us instructors

24
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:55,640
anything you may want, like, what do you recommend for this case or that case, and so on.

25
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:05,320
And in fact, you can ask some good questions and, you know, try to get us debating each

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,080
other about what's the right answer.

27
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,880
Or maybe there is no clear right answer.

28
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes, sometimes programs are a bit like lawyers.

29
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
It depends.

30
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,800
Yeah, and often like I think it happens

31
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,720
quite often in the Python ecosystem that it's basically like

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,040
Once you start your studies and you start your bachelor's and that sort of thing,

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,880
you have your friends in the same courses and you're all working on the same courses

34
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,040
and you do the same things because those are the basics. And basically the NumPy and Pandas and

35
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,280
those sort of things, Matplotlib, they are the basics when it comes to scientific computing

36
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,280
with Python. Those are where everybody goes. But then it quite quickly diverges into different

37
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,120
fields. Different fields have different needs and different tools they use. Neuroimaging,

38
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:15,880
they need to do 3D plotting of MRI slices or something like that. If you do deep learning,

39
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,240
you do completely different tools. Of course, the ecosystem is still the same and everybody's

40
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,760
working the same kind of things, but the problems become more specialized and specific for the field.

41
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,160
And that makes it, of course, hard to give a general answer, what is good.

42
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:44,760
But what we can hopefully provide is some semblance of like, there are these kinds of tools that go across all of these different fields.

43
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:52,760
They are tools that are like ecosystem tools and these kinds of things that help you or processes, like packaging in a certain way,

44
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:00,360
or that help you maybe even if you're working in a very specific field. But of course like every

45
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,120
field has their own special cases that might be complicated or certain kinds of like plotting

46
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,960
or certain kind of thing and you need to like yeah it's a different like specific question

47
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:24,200
at that field, of course. Yeah, there's some good comments here about today being advanced

48
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:36,360
and getting stuck. And yeah, I mean, this is unfortunately something that happens sometimes.

49
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:45,240
We have such a broad audience here, we tried to do something that's a little bit interesting

50
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,040
for advanced people, and for people who get stuck, you can still watch it and take it

51
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,240
as a demo, and then learn more yourself later.

52
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:03,240
I think that's the only way to manage such a wide audience.

53
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:14,600
Yeah, and there are different ways of working in different systems. So, for example, many of

54
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,440
the things might be that we go to a terminal and in Windows you don't usually work with a terminal

55
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,320
that often. You don't necessarily use that much of it. The working environment might be different.

56
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,120
But in Windows, let's say you use VS Code or something, you might have or PyCharm or something,

57
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:39,640
and they can replicate. With an IDE, you can get an even better working environment than with a

58
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:47,720
terminal, in many cases, like you would do maybe in a Linux system. So there are different ways of

59
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,520
working. So there's no right answer. It is only answer that you want to choose from.

60
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,240
So if you encounter problems with, let's say, environment creation or some of the

61
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,760
command line things or scripting or these kind of things, like PyCharm and VSCode,

62
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,880
you can give arguments to run. When you run, press the green button to run a code,

63
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,800
you can give it arguments to run like it would run as a script. So you can basically demo

64
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,160
how it would behave as a script, even when you're not using terminal. And this is quite common

65
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,920
in the IDE world. So there's different ways of working with the same things. But of course,

66
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,480
when we present it, we present it with the way that we most commonly see in our users,

67
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,760
which is using the command lines or scripts and that sort of thing. But the same things can apply

68
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:49,960
to different workflows as well. Yeah, so we're over time. If there's no more comments from

69
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,040
anyone, maybe I'd wrap up with this one comment at the bottom. I like this course. It gives a good

70
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,000
overview of good coding practices, but the course requires weeks of hands-on practice to learn.

71
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,600
And I'd say that's absolutely true. And for a 12-hour course, I think any one of the lessons

72
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:17,720
we teach could easily become a 12-hour course just on their own. And our goal here is to show

73
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,800
you what's possible and give you a little bit of hands-on practice of what's there,

74
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,680
but to inspire you to go learn these later on. And you can learn them by

75
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,360
doing yourself reading more, or probably more likely working with other people that do things

76
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,760
and finding it together. If you're at any of the universities that have partners, you can try

77
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,560
asking the people that are advertising the course and see if they can provide support in these

78
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:57,640
things. At Aalto University we do plenty of this and I know the people in Sweden and Norway are

79
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:04,440
very happy to help you with these kinds of things. So with that being said, should we

80
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Should we wrap up?

81
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,360
I think so.

82
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Okay, great. Thank you so much.

83
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,360
See you tomorrow, same time.

84
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Yes, thank you. Bye.
