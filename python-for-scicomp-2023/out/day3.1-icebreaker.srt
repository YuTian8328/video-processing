1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So, as usual we've got some icebreakers here.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Today, we do a bit more than usual with a command line interface, so you can answer

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,960
the size breaker.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,640
This question, I didn't write it very well.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,100
How do you run the same things over and over again, but with slightly different parameters?

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,160
So this is like you have 10 different datasets, and you want to run the same code on all of

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:48,280
of them, or you have one data set

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,620
and you need to run with 10 different values

9
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,920
of some parameter.

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,040
So how would you do that?

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,440
OK, there's these other questions here,

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,760
which we can try to answer in a bit.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,040
But we have a special guest with us.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:11,280
So [name], can you introduce yourself?

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,560
Yeah, sure.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,120
Yeah, so I'm [name].

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,480
I'm based in Finland.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,840
And at the moment, I'm finishing my PhD in computer science.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,920
And I'm also working in industry as a Julia software developer

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,040
in a startup for AI.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,680
So yeah, I'm a Julia enthusiast.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,960
And in Finland, I organized this Julia Users Helsinki.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,200
It is a small community of people in Helsinki area, or even outside the Helsinki area,

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,400
who want to come together and talk about Julia.

25
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,400
Yeah. And you may wonder, why do we have a Julia visitor here in a Python course?

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,320
Yeah. And indeed, I brought the white flag because, you know,

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,720
I come in peace and also want to live in one piece.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,280
But I mean, my answer to that is that, why not?

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,760
I mean, it's not like one language is better than another

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,800
for everything.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,860
But there's all these different things here.

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,080
And knowing more about different languages

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,400
would have helped me in the future some, or in the past.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
But also, the idea is to have role models

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
of different kinds of career paths.

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,040
So [name], can you tell us a little bit about how

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,520
you got to where you are now?

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,880
Like, what's your background, and how did you like?

39
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Yeah, so my background is more like computer science, signal

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,440
process, statistical signal processing, that kind of stuff.

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,400
And I was like, when I think when I started doing my master

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,160
thesis, I had like the traditional story that I was

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,720
doing a lot of coding at the beginning, I was doing in a very

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,360
like painful way, like moving files around, and that felt

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,120
wrong. So I started like getting more into proper way and got

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,760
like more into proper scientific computing, and so on. And

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,960
And also, I heard about open source communities, and I was interested in that.

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,920
And at some point, Julia came under my radar.

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,020
So I heard about this Julia language that was meant for scientific computing and researchers.

50
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,960
And I was pretty interested in it.

51
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,360
But what really sparkled my enthusiasm about Julia wasn't even the technical features of

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Julia.

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,600
Because at the beginning, I didn't know anything about it.

54
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
I didn't know why it was good.

55
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,560
I didn't know about internals or multiple dispatch or metaprogramming or whatever.

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,800
What was cool is that it was beginning 2020.

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,360
I had started my PhD and as you probably remember, COVID had also started, so I was stuck in

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,220
my room and I joined the Julia Slack.

59
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:48,600
And then it was pretty cool to see how everybody was very friendly, how everybody was very

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
active.

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,280
And I was seeing famous people, like people of popular Julia packages, who were sitting

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,920
there answering my dumb questions and getting me step-by-step, so it was more this community

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,000
feeling that really got me into open source, so I sticked to Julia.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,240
Then I actually started writing documentation, so I was in this Google Summer of Docs for

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,560
writing documentation, and I started building a web page for a couple of libraries, and

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,120
writing documentation for libraries. And then I was twice in this Google Summer of Code

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,680
program, like doing more Julia programming. And after that, I also found a job as a software

68
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,280
developer, Julian, like a startup through like people I knew in the Julia community.

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,720
And I have, of course, like been using Julia in my research also for like for my PhD and

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,200
for my own research. And yeah,

71
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,320
Julian is a pretty new language, right?

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,840
Yeah, we celebrated the last year's 10 years of Julia

73
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,860
There was this a HackMD kind of a yearbook where you could design your experience of 10 years of Julia

74
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,500
so it was I think the first commit was from 2009 and the first

75
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,940
Public release was from 2012 and it achieved the version 1.0 at the 2018

76
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
it was developed at MIT and

77
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,540
And the goal of Julia was to solve this so-called two-language problem.

78
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,780
So, you know, you encounter this problem that you start writing in Python,

79
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,500
and then you hit some performance bottlenecks, because Python is an interpreted language,

80
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,660
and then you needed to rewrite it in C.

81
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:35,060
Or also, people who use Python, actually, under the hood, TensorFlow is written in C.

82
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,420
Or a lot of libraries are written in C or Python.

83
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,900
Sorry, in Cython, I meant, not Python.

84
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:48,500
So whereas in Julia, the power about Julia is that it allows to prototype and achieve

85
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,820
performance in the same language. So the magic word here is multiple dispatch,

86
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,700
and there's a very inspiring talk like the unreasonable effectiveness of multiple dispatch

87
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:08,020
from JuliaCon 2019, which explains how it achieves both dynamicity and performance.

88
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:20,020
Okay. Interesting. Okay, so we're almost where we need to begin the next lesson.

89
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:28,020
Anyone have any questions for [name]? If you do, please write down there.

90
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:35,340
there. So [name], there's something I always ask people. So what do you know now that you

91
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,460
wish someone had told you at the start of your career?

92
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:48,260
Yeah. So what for like more like my open source career, like being involved in the Julia community,

93
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,380
like one thing that I really wished people like told me before, which I learned kind

94
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:01,300
of my experience is that you really don't need to be scared to start and you don't need

95
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,340
to ask permission. That's a good thing about open source. Also, at the beginning, when

96
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,780
I started, I was a bit shy. I was like, okay, maybe a first prototype in closed repository.

97
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,820
Should I open it? Will people just say it's dumb or will people steal my job or stuff

98
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,180
like that, but this doesn't happen in open source, at least not in Julia communities,

99
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,060
like a reasonable size for it not to happen.

100
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,100
So just put your code out there and don't be afraid.

101
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,660
The best way to get the answer is not to ask the question, it's to post the wrong answer.

102
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,860
So just put your code out there, put your work out there, and people will help you.

103
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,500
You don't need to be afraid of that.

104
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:48,540
And actually, similarly applies to research, at least like in my field, I don't need to

105
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,080
worry that much about scooping.

106
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,500
So it's pretty cool that also research

107
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,120
I can put my code and my work out there publicly

108
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,680
and I just meet new people.

109
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,440
So that, and maybe other quick thing about

110
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,240
is that open source is not about code, it's about community.

111
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,200
So we have already a lot of people coding in open source

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,560
and of course the more the merrier,

113
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
but we also need the non-technical people in open source,

114
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,320
people helping with writing documentation,

115
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,620
people helping with bringing people together,

116
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,440
people helping with improving diversity

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,920
inclusion. So open source is really not about code, but it's more about community. And as I mentioned,

118
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,640
like, I got, like, sparkled from truly not because of multiple dispatch, which I didn't know what it

119
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,600
was, but because of people friendliness. So, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks. And I can also

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,080
say about what [name] said about putting your code out there. If you want to be hired somewhere,

121
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,440
like whenever I'm looking to hire people, having public code and saying that,

122
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,440
like being able to see things, that's a huge benefit there.

123
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,080
Okay, but now we need to get started.

124
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,800
Thanks for visiting.

125
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,120
Yeah, last thing, if you are in Finland, we have every month in Helsinki,

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,320
this Julia Helsinki meetup, except not this month,

127
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,680
but the next one is going to be on the 13th of December,

128
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,760
and it's gonna be especially for beginners about Julia, so we're gonna be like intro about Julia

129
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:22,200
and about how to use Julia research and teaching. I also put in the notes, so 13th of December. It's

130
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,960
not official, it's not even on the website yet, but I can give you the spoiler of this. Congrats

131
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,560
and hope to see you there. Yeah, okay, great, thank you. Yeah, thank you for having me. Bye.

132
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,120
Okay, bye.

133
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,840
So, with that said, I guess we should get started for the day.

134
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,840
Yes, so the first lesson is [name] and I.

135
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,960
Hello, [name], have you already introduced yourself? I think so.

136
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,360
I don't think so. I think this is my first appearance this year.

137
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,080
So yeah, I'm a research software engineer at Arthur University, working in [Name]'s group

138
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:15,240
and in general interested in programming.

139
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,000
In general. Okay, so what's our first lesson of today?
