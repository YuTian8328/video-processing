- workshop_title: Linux shell scripting 2024
- workshop_description: >
    You might have already used Linux shell commands interactively,
    but how do you go from interactive terminal use to non-interactive
    workflow with scripts? This course is oriented on those who want
    to start using BASH programming fully and use terminal
    efficiently.

    We expect that course participants are familiar with the shell
    basics (experience with BASH, ZSH, etc). We somewhat touch the
    Part 1 of the Linux Shell tutorial, and continue to Part 2. Though
    we expect that participant knows how to create a directory and can
    edit file from the linux shell command line. We will be scripting
    a lot, there will be lots of demos and real practicing.
