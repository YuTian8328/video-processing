- workshop_title: Linux shell scripting 2024
- workshop_description: >
    You might have already used Linux shell commands interactively,
    but how do you go from interactive terminal use to non-interactive
    workflow with scripts? This course is oriented on those who want
    to start using BASH programming fully and use terminal
    efficiently.

    We expect that course participants are familiar with the shell
    basics (experience with BASH, ZSH, etc). We somewhat touch the
    Part 1 of the Linux Shell tutorial, and continue to Part 2. Though
    we expect that participant knows how to create a directory and can
    edit file from the linux shell command line. We will be scripting
    a lot, there will be lots of demos and real practicing.

  title: Day 1 (variables, functions, environments)
  description: >-
    This day mainly covers ways to make scripts (basics, like where to
    put them to be executable), variables, functions, and environment
    variables.  There is a brief extra bit about redirections.

  title: Day 3 (input, here docs, traps, parallelization)
  description: >-
    This day covers different ways to get input to the shell, traps
    (which allow responding to signals or outside events), and the
    lightweight paralellization that a shell allows (which isn't that
    much).
