1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, let's get started. It's already 12 o'clock.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So welcome everyone to this second part of the Linux shell course.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's called Linux shell scripting.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
My name is [name].

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm at Aalto University working for the Aalto scientific computing.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And so the practical aspects of this course, a few notes.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,520
There will be a couple of documents which we will be using.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,300
So one of them is the material itself.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,520
It's the, you should have received already an email

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,400
from [name].

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,640
So there were a couple of links, including this Zoom link.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,920
And on top of that, there were also a link

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,920
to this AaltoSciComp at GitHub.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,680
So here we have our Linux shell course.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,780
So that's already the course continuation.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,780
The first part was given already in the autumn,

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,980
but no worries, we will come back to this.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,300
I will tell you shortly what we expected.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,740
So let's continue with the documents.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,740
There will be feedback form for yourself and for ourselves.

21
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:20,740
So this is the HedgeDoc, pretty much like HackMD, just the branch of this.

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:27,740
And so here will be your questions, here will be our comments, our references,

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,740
and we will keep it up to date and updated all the three days.

24
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,740
So the second part of this course, I mean this part of this course,

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,740
it's gonna be the three hours each, three times,

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,380
today, tomorrow, and after tomorrow.

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,100
We will start precisely at 12,

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,720
but then actually the Zoom sessions

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,820
will be open already a bit in advance.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,260
So if you have any question,

31
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,260
or if you need some kind of issues to resolve,

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,140
so you can also join the Zoom session a bit earlier,

33
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,100
and we will take a look at your issue.

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,480
So what is my expectation from your side?

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,880
I expect that you already somewhat

36
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,020
spend some time to get your terminal open

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,200
so that you have access to Linux.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,820
I'm not talking about that you have full type

39
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,900
of Linux installation.

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,540
It's full enough if you have some exercise connection

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,540
to your, be it interactive server at your university

42
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,780
or maybe your workstation.

43
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,260
That's enough if you have your own Linux laptop,

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,420
that's even better.

45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,700
So you can do it locally.

46
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,300
So pretty much anything which will give you

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,400
a Bash session open for you.

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,980
So that's regarding this one.

49
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,620
So what you can expect from this course is that

50
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,620
we will go through all the scripting abilities of the Bash.

51
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:05,540
abilities of the bash. So what you expect by the end of the course you should be

52
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,860
able to write already your own scripts and we will start with very simple ones

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,260
like hello bash and then we will continue to keep the increase in the

54
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,660
level of complexity and then by the end of the day you should be able to create

55
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:26,100
something which is more or less suitable for your CV and something which you will

56
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,060
be able to put finally on the github if you have an account over there. So regarding these notes,

57
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:42,020
notes on the code refinery.org. So if you go there you can easily go to the edit mode

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:49,620
or you can have them both and you can see what you are typing in. So just make sure that

59
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:57,660
well if you have any question then you can click the help button and so you

60
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,860
will see more or less the references about the syntax of this code and then

61
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:10,940
don't hesitate to ask the questions over here. So we streamed this

62
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,740
lecture and that's streaming we're also recording it so you're muted and you do

63
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,540
appear on the recording so that's the point why we actually want these

64
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:29,340
questions to be answered to be asked to be answered in this kind of text mode

65
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,220
so but feel free it's anonymous you don't need to have any kind of account

66
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,860
just go there my setup my setup is going to be as next so our sandbox our

67
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,460
working horse will be here the terminal so this is what I have so I have a

68
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,700
prompt and I have the blinking cursor which will be waiting for me to start typing the commands.

69
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,820
Because of the commands they sometimes provide quite long outputs. So what we've done also,

70
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:07,540
I have another one terminal over here which will automatically output what I'm typing here.

71
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,620
So if I'm typing the command like echo test it will appear over here. You will find it useful

72
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,180
later when the screen will go off and the will be polluted already by the output of the different

73
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:26,740
and or I will clear the screen somehow of my terminal and so you can still look at these

74
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:36,180
commands over here. That's not it. I have also done this my demo space in my home directory on

75
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:47,220
my local computer as part of my university page. So I have on my university page a directory called

76
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:56,660
shell. If you go to this https users auto.fi my username and shell so you should have this link

77
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,500
actually over here on the code refinery so you don't need to type it on your own just click it

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,420
over there so here you will get first here we'll get all the scripts that we will be preparing

79
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,460
they will be automatically added over here to the web page and then also you will hear the whole

80
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,500
you will here see the whole bash history it's easy to take it out from here and copy paste it to your

81
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,620
on terminal. Okay, by saying that I think I'm pretty much done with it.

82
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:38,900
So this is a hands-on tutorial. So my target over here is to be more or less 50-50. If I'm saying

83
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,700
something like for 10 minutes then I expect that we will spend 10 minutes on actually doing

84
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,060
something. So there will be lots of doing over here and so it does really make sense that you

85
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:57,460
have your terminal open and you have all the setup ready to go.

86
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,460
I think this is pretty much what I had to say about

87
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:09,380
the initial part. If any question is left then please go and type it over here.

88
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,340
I'm not alone on this course. I'm the speaking

89
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,820
kind of head but there will be several of our team guys

90
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:26,020
helping you and me to answer these questions so if you type the question be sure there will be

91
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:33,460
someone to reply you pretty much immediately so there is will be work done in the background

92
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,460
but let's get back to the material so this linux shell basics has been given as i told you already

93
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,460
in autumn so now we will be working on the linux shell scripting the material is quite

94
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,860
It's comprehensive.

95
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,220
This is the one which is online.

96
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,420
I will not read you from the slides.

97
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
I don't have actually any slide over here.

98
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,880
I will use its material.

99
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
And everything what I will be saying,

100
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,500
it's more or less somewhere here,

101
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,380
but I don't really follow directly the material itself.

102
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,700
And the exercises which are part of this material

103
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,420
and actually written fully by our team,

104
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,020
they will appear over here.

105
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,920
So I have an example of first exercise

106
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,240
and so that you, when we will come to this,

107
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,960
you will see how it will go full.

108
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,720
Okay, so the first icebreaker and the starter.

109
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,420
So you're told already, if you haven't answered yet

110
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,840
the question, please try to do it also over here.

111
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,040
So that will give us some picture of what we are doing

112
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,900
and who is taking the course.

113
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:49,000
and let's get your hands dirty so my first touch will be actually writing the script
